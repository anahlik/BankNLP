answer,"Good morning, John.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q18.pdf
question,"Good morning. On the McKinsey study, just wanted to see if you can update us with your any expectations you've developed out of that in terms of a targeted efficiency and how much of that – of any target that comes out of that would you expect would be revenue versus expenses? Thanks.",John Pancari,Analyst,Evercore ISI,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q18.pdf
answer,"Yeah, John, this is David. So we had elements of McKinsey built into the guidance that we've given you for 2018. We're still working through – we just kind of got the first part of this done in the first quarter. There's a lot more to do and we're going to update you on kind of a three-year – this is going to be a longer journey. This is not a 2018 only. We'll have elements of this working through a couple of years, two to three years actually. We're going to update all that at our Investor Day, which will happen in February of 2019. That being said, there's elements of McKinsey of how we keep our expense number relatively flat this year and there's elements of McKinsey on how we get the growth in revenue of 3% to 6% on NIR for 2018 as well. As we think about the total commitment on revenue, it's about 70% of it is expense and about 30% of it is on the revenue side. That's our best guess thus far. We will refine those as we go through the remainder of our Simplify and Grow initiative. From an efficiency ratio standpoint, we've given you guidance. It will be below 60%. As you know we had a – when the tax rate changed, that caused all of us, all of our peers for the tax adjustment, for us, it was about 50 basis points going the other way. We did not change our guidance because we had Simplify and Grow and we also had our insurance transaction in mind at that time. So we think we're confident and we'll have an efficiency ratio below 60% in 2018. That being said, we think over time we're going to need to be in that mid-50%s and we're working towards that.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q18.pdf
question,"Got it. Thank you. That's helpful. And then separately on the capital side, you mentioned the insurance sale and along those lines, can you just talk to us about how you're thinking about the business mix if there's other areas of the business that you think you would possibly exit? And then conversely, how are you thinking about additions to the business in terms of whole bank M&A and maybe a [ph] fall (26:30) on the environment? Thanks.",John Pancari,Analyst,Evercore ISI,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q18.pdf
answer,"John, the first of all, the Regions Insurance has been a part of our business for a while, It's a very – we made a very analytical and thoughtful evaluation of that. It was a valuable asset for us. Very talented team in the Regions Insurance group. But we had reached a point in our analysis where we had to make a decision on how best to deploy our capital and should we try to increase the scale of our participation in that segment or was there a more valuable asset for someone else. And as you see we came to what was a complex but thoughtful decision that took what was a very valuable asset to us and we think we made a good decision for ourselves, for our customers and for our team members that are in that business. When we look at opportunities to grow, as we've said in the past, we're primarily focused on organic growth, trying to determine how to do that. We, on a very ongoing disciplined basis, look at how we're allocating our capital by product, by business, by geography, and we look for opportunities to acquire where it will help accelerate growth. We've been fairly active in non-bank acquisitions. We continue to review those opportunities. We've been very studious on bank acquisitions but continue to look at the markets and how we trade versus banks that we might be interested in, and it's still economically challenging. So while we're looking at it, we're studying it. We understand where the markets are at. We just think the opportunity for bank M&A for us is fairly limited at the moment. And so we're trying to prioritize how we grow. And again, I think, organic's first way we grow and non-bank acquisition is the second way we grow at this moment.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q18.pdf
question,"Got it. All right, thanks, Grayson.",John Pancari,Analyst,Evercore ISI,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q18.pdf
answer,"Hi, Ryan.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q18.pdf
question,"Hey, good morning, guys. Hi, Grayson. Maybe I'll ask John's question a little different way. Was there a full business review done in making the decision to selling the insurance business, and are you currently looking at other businesses to potentially sell that you're either subscale or you're not achieving your desired returns? O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr. Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer, Regions Financial Corp. A I mean, Ryan, absolutely. I mean, we take a full business review, all of our businesses on a fairly frequent basis. But we – David has probably mentioned it hundreds of times in terms of optimizing our allocation of capital and we've really spent a lot of time not only in our finance team but also in our business leadership teams determining exactly what a reasonable rate of return is for those businesses. We set different hurdles for them. As you might imagine, we debate them back and forth because those profit pools expand and contract depending on where you're at in the cycle. And so we look at – we try to look at these businesses on a long-term sustainable basis, not just a particular point in time. As you might imagine, our decision to divest Regions Insurance was a difficult decision because we've been in that business for a long time and, like I said, a great team of people running it. But when we look at the risk adjusted returns in that business and what we had to do to improve those, we came to the conclusion given where those assets are trading today that the best decision for us was to divest that business. We look at all our businesses that way and not that we intend to share our debates but you could can rest assured that there is a rigorous debate going on all the time regarding the businesses that we're in. David, do you want to add that?",Ryan M. Nash,Analyst,Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q18.pdf
answer,"Yeah. I would say that there are a lot of factors that we look at, as Grayson mentioned, in evaluating a business. We look at how synergistic businesses are or not. In this particular case, insurance, we had more of a retail platform than BB&T did. BB&T has a wholesale platform that they can marry up with retail. They had more scale in the business than we did and, for us, to get the scale we thought we needed to have to become more efficient at it, as you can see now that the efficiency ratio was pretty high for us in the business, and to get the scale and efficiency ratio down was going to require a disproportionate amount of capital investment that we felt we could use elsewhere. And it's a good thing, it's a good business, good people. As a matter of fact we use them as well and we think that BB&T can do more with it than we can and we have – we'll put our capital to use in a more appropriate fashion.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q18.pdf
answer,"And we do think it is a good transaction for us, and likewise I think it was a good transaction for BB&T.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q18.pdf
question,"Got it. Thanks for all the color. And I guess, David, you note in the slides that consumer betas are near zero, commercial is running just below 40%. Can you maybe just give us a sense what's baked into your 4% to 6% NII growth for the rest of the year? And have you had to make any changes on the consumer side with the most recent hikes? Thanks for taking my question.",Ryan M. Nash,Analyst,Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q18.pdf
answer,"Yes. So you're right. That consumer beta has been low to nonexistent. We do think that we'll get pressure over time, and we aren't seeing it on the consumer side yet, but we expect that to happen. We have a beta still baked in in that 35% range going up to 60% over time. The commercial side, a lot of that's indexed to the funds rate or other rates in wealth management. And we've been fairly conservative with our betas. They've proven out better than we thought. We're at 13% cumulative beta, and we think for the next – maybe the next one or two moves, maybe we keep it low. But over time it's going to catch up to where we think it's going to be in that 40% to 60% range. As you think about Q2, we really don't put a beta forecast as we haven't given you that, but we expect that to be fairly similar to what we just saw this past quarter.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q18.pdf
question,Thanks for the color.,Ryan M. Nash,Analyst,Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q18.pdf
answer,"Good Morning, Erika.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q18.pdf
question,"Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. I just wanted to get a little bit of clarity in terms of timing of announcement regarding some of the conclusions from Simplify and Grow. I think the market had been expecting an update, a more formal update in the summer. I'm wondering if there still will be a formal update in the summer in addition to during your February 2019 Investor Day or should we wait until the 2019 Investor Day to get a more robust update?",Erika Najarian,Analyst,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q18.pdf
answer,"Erika, what we want to do is make sure we have a very solid footing on our Simplify and Grow, the effects of that on our business before we go to the market with it. I think what we've learned over time since our Investor Day is credibility. We're doing what we said we're going to do. We want to make sure we're ready and have the right commitment. We do know that will happened by Investor Day. So you have a lot of clarity at Investor Today. And to the extent we get further down the road, we'll give you an update as we determine that and I think we'll have probably something incremental. Each quarter, we'll give you something incremental. But the full-fledged here's what it's going to mean for a really 2019 and 2020 and beyond is at Investor Day. As you can imagine putting things in motion today, it takes time to garner the benefit of those changes. And so, we don't see a ton of change on our business. And in all of 2018, you'll see elements of that trickling in the back half of 2018 and we'll give you that guidance as it becomes known and perhaps we'll will give you that guidance as it becomes know and perhaps we'll will give you some incremental in the second quarter.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q18.pdf
answer,"But, Erika, I would say that you're going to hear from us every quarter on things that we're doing that we more broadly place under that umbrella. You clearly heard this quarter on our sale of the troubled debt restructured loans, that broadly falls under the Simplify and Grow umbrella. We also had the Regions Insurance sale. We also in the prepared remarks gave you how much our head count was down quarter-over-quarter as well as how much it was down year-over-year. You've seen a number of public press releases on our reorganization efforts in terms of how we line up to go to market. And so, you're going to hear these every quarter and this quarter was probably one of the more informative quarters we've had in a while and you'll see that continue throughout the year. To David's point, we'll continue to give those every quarter. But then you'll see us embed those in our three-year forecast at Investor Day next February. But it's not like you've got to wait for February to hear some of this. But clearly, some of these things we're doing, we can't pre-announce prior to actually executing the transactions.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q18.pdf
question,"Got it. So my follow-up then is, is the better way to think about it is Simplify and Grow is part of your business as usual way of conducting your day-to-day. And so as we think about 2018 or 2019, even though the formal announcement is not until February, you're still Simplify and Grow – taking those initiatives that your shareholders can reap benefits in 2018 and 2019?",Erika Najarian,Analyst,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q18.pdf
answer,"Absolutely. And then, I wouldn't say – I wouldn't cast February as a formal announcement of Simplify and Grow. February is a formal announcement of our next three year plan and in our Simplify and Grow activities will be embedded in that plan.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q18.pdf

answer,"Good morning, Betsy.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q18.pdf
question,"Good morning. Couple of questions. One is on the 2018 expectations. You indicated the fee growth target and obviously, you have sold the insurance business. So I just wanted to make sure I understood that there's other areas that are going to be picking up and making up for the insurance business sales. Is that accurate?",Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q18.pdf
answer,"Well, so we put the Regions Insurance group as discontinued operations and we restated everything. So you got to go back to the restated baseline as well. So we're talking about 3% to 6% off of that. We're not going to do 3% to 6% off of overcoming the...","David J.

answer,...the gross revenue of insurance.,"David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q18.pdf
question,"Right. And so, what you're suggesting is that the fee growth rate really was not being impacted by the insurance business?",Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q18.pdf
answer,That's right.,"David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q18.pdf

answer,Regardless.,"David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q18.pdf
question,"All right. Okay. And then, just on some of the investments, you mentioned the de novo branches. Maybe if you could give us a sense of size, scale, scope, market, timing?",Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q18.pdf
answer,I'll ask John Owen to respond to that.,"O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q18.pdf
answer,"Good morning. This is John Owen. Yeah. We're going to roll out probably 20 branches this year. They'd be concentrated really in three markets. St. Louis will be the majority. Roughly, eight or nine of our branches will open in St. Louis in the really second, third quarter time period. Atlanta would be another market where we're going to open branches on this quarter and last would be Houston. So those would be the key markets. You'll see the roughly 20 branches open this year. There'll be a few infill markets, and Memphis and Knoxville and Charlotte will infill as well. The other thing on the branching standpoint, we mentioned consolidation. We've got roughly 30 to 40 consolidations teed up as well. So you'll see our net branch count will be down a little bit, but you'll see us continue to invest in key markets.",John B. Owen,Senior Executive Vice President & Head-Regional Banking Group,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q18.pdf
question,"Okay. And then that trajectory of investment and expense, say, obviously feeds into the efficiency ratio expectations you've got. Do you feel like this type of pace is something to continue into in 2019, over the next couple of years or you feel like your branch network will be where you want it to be by the end of this year?",Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q18.pdf
answer,"Yeah, I would tell you over the next two to three years, you'll see us continue to build roughly 20 to 30 branches a year in select markets. We also have opportunities where we can continue to consolidate. The opportunities on consolidation are getting a little bit harder, if you will. We consolidated in the last two years about 10% of our network over the last two years. And there's opportunity where a lot of that opportunity is what I'll call two for ones or three for ones, where we're taking a branch and expanding a branch to absorb two or three other branches that are nearby. So you'll see us balance out building and consolidating.",John B. Owen,Senior Executive Vice President & Head-Regional Banking Group,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q18.pdf
answer,"But, Betsy, our branch rationalization process is part of how we manage channels in general, whether through our digital channel or contact centers, our ATMs, our branches. And it's a fairly dynamic review and it's been one we've had in place for a quite some time. And to John's point, we'll continue to make annual adjustments to that as we see markets change and we see customer behavior change. And so it's a very analytical process and so we may forecast out three years on that, but we review them constantly, so if we need to make in-flight adjustments, we can do that.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q18.pdf
answer,The other thing I would add is the fact that the reason we've been able to consolidate as many branches we have is our investments in online and mobile space. We have a lot of self-service transactions go to online and mobile. And that's allowed really us to consolidate and not impact our growth.,John B. Owen,Senior Executive Vice President & Head-Regional Banking Group,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q18.pdf
question,"And just one last one, on video ATMs, we were down there recently. It was interesting to see how much functionality that has. And I was wondering, is that strategy of video ATM, A, kind of fill in of existing footprint or is it more an opportunity to expand footprint?",Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q18.pdf
answer,"We've got roughly 90 video ATMs deployed. It really is – what we're finding out, we're testing in a couple of different ways. One, inside our branches, we're using the vestibules to extend banking hours. And to your point, customers can do most of their banking transactions on that video teller, have an opportunity to talk to an experienced banker that can help them with those transactions that we've seen good adoption in our branches in the vestibules. We've also tried it in a few drive-through ATMs. I would tell you those are not quite as high usage, because we don't have the ability to assist that customer and walk them through the process as well. So we're seeing good adoptions in the branch.",John B. Owen,Senior Executive Vice President & Head-Regional Banking Group,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q18.pdf
answer,"Yeah, and I think, Betsy, if you look at our ATM network, we've continued to invest in that channel and we've image enabled all of our traditional ATMs and we're seeing customer transactional behavior improve at what we would call a somewhat traditional ATM. We've been encouraged by the video tellers, but it also has been a learning process. We found some places they worked great, in some places, not so great. We think it's an interesting technology. We think that there's a place for it in our channel portfolio. But I would tell you, we're still in the early stages of that. Even with 90 units in our portfolio – 90 units, even in that regard, that is a fairly small investment, but it's allowing us to learn how we might deploy it on a larger basis.","O. B.

question,"Thanks. Good morning. Hey, good morning, Grayson. Good morning, David. First question just on the capital markets front within fees, another good quarter down a little bit, but expected. You talked about that being a big contributor to fee growth this year. Can you talk about just pipelines where it's coming from and how much more you might have to still hire to build and bulk that business up? Thanks.",Ken Usdin,Analyst,Jefferies LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q18.pdf
answer,"This is John Turner. We expect it to be a nice contributor to revenue growth, nice revenue growth through the balance of the year. I think what you're saying is the maturation of the various product offerings that we've put together and the capabilities that we've developed. For the quarter, the growth in revenue over year – year-over- year growth in revenue was broad-based across a number of different product categories whether it was long- term real estate financing products, it was M&A, it was loan syndications, all improved your-over-year and, again, I think really reflect the maturation of the capabilities and our teams having better conversations with our customers about how we can meet their specific needs. In terms of investments, we're continuing to recruit and will continue to recruit. We see some capabilities that we still probably would aspire to have or to continue to build out. And so we expect capital markets to continue to grow nicely in 2018, on into 2019. Pipelines are pretty good for the second quarter and into part of the third quarter at this point.",John Turner,President & Head of Corporate Banking Group,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q18.pdf
question,Got it. Okay. And then my last – the question is just on all things credit continue to look excellence all measures and you had another big quarter of reserve release. I know you're saying bottom end of the charge offs this year but is it also fair to say that there is still amount of relief that we could still see even from here? Thanks guys.,Ken Usdin,Analyst,Jefferies LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q18.pdf
answer,"Yeah, Ken. So we don't forecast what the reserve percentage is going to be. We're at 105%. We still have non- performing assets. While they're down 75 basis points, we think there is room to continue to improve. We're encouraged by that. The strength of the commercial customer, the strength of the consumer is there. There are elements of consumer that ticked up just a little bit. Card would be one. But we see the consumer being very stable. We just don't think that the consumer credit metrics improved as much as we believe the commercial credit metrics can kind of continue to come down which manifest themselves as, I mean, in non-performing loans and non-performing assets. So there is always possibility for a reserve release, depends on what happens with the criticized classifieds. And we'll let the model run and it speaks for itself.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q18.pdf
answer,"Well, I do think you saw this quarter the very encouraging improvement. Our credit metrics, a big part of that was payoffs and paydowns on some adversely rating credits that quite frankly we did not anticipate it. Those are very difficult to forecast, but it's also encouraging that those customers can find alternative forms of financing today, and so we do anticipate that there is an opportunity for that trend to continue through the rest of the year.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q18.pdf

answer,"Good morning, Chris.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q18.pdf
question,"Hi, good morning. My question is just a follow-up on the Simplify and Grow strategy, and the role of technology, and the March reorg that you had where you're putting technology under John Owen, the philosophy behind that? And also a lot of the tech spend it seems to be self-funding. Do you think that's going to continue into 2019? Thank you.",Christopher Spahr,Analyst,Wells Fargo Securities LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q18.pdf
answer,"Yeah, I mean, if you look back historically, we've had a very consistent investment strategy in the technology. We've not varied that a lot year-to-year. I think we've been pretty disciplined in that regard, and we're quite proud of the technology platform we've built. My background for the bulk of my career was in technology. John Owen has a similar background as well, and John has worked hard to strengthen and align the strategy in particular around our consumer customers with all of the attention to digital channels that we have. As you know, Scott Peters runs our Consumer Banking Group, and he and John work together. We have an approach from a technology perspective, of not being the leader but being an aggressive follower of proven technology and that strategy's worked well for us. We have done a number of upgrades in technology over the past few quarters, a substantial upgrade on human resources for technology, wealth management, complete upgrade of that infrastructure, and in addition, treasury management. So we continue to make improvements. We get a lot of internal and external benchmarks that would indicate that that's working. So John, elaborate if you would.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q18.pdf
answer,"Just a couple of points to reiterate. From a technology standpoint, we've been consistent even through the financial crisis. We've had really significant investments in technology. And if I think about consumer for a minute, we're very fortunate to operate a one-consumer platform across all of our 1,470 branches. That gives us an advantage over competitors that have multiple platforms that they have to maintain and change over time. We also offer very good digital capabilities, invested heavily in our digital space in both online and mobile banking. Our customers give us good feedback. We have J.D. Power really survey our customers every quarter to get feedback on where we can make changes and where we can improve and we come in every quarter in the top quartile in terms of our channel capabilities. From kind of an ATM and video teller standpoint, we rolled out DepositSmart ATMs across our entire footprint. About 90 video tellers, we mentioned earlier, we're testing. So a lot of investment both in the digital space and the ATM space and branch channel. To move on to the wealth business, as Grayson mentioned, we converted about 14 platforms on to our SCI platform which really is a state-of-the-art platform, great customer experience, great associate experience also gives us a better price point going forward. From a commercial standpoint, the team's done a really good job of putting new iTreasury platform, which gives us a much better user interface, better reporting, better analytics in our treasury space. And they're working very hard with nCino to roll out new small business and commercial platforms. So a lot of good things happening. I'll tell you, this is one of those areas where you'll never be done. We're going to continually have to invest in the digital space and really balance out where we make our investments and where we place our bets, but I feel good about the platform we have in place.",John B.

question,"Good morning. I just want to flesh out the margin expectations for the second quarter here a bit more. In particular, obviously, should benefit from the rate hike, but it looks like your borrowings came down at period end and probably have a little bit more margin expansion than one would just expect from a straight rate hike?",Steve Moss,Analyst,"B.

answer,"Well, so we have a day count change going into the second quarter. So don't forget that's two points going the other way. And we were up four points this quarter as a result of day count. When you consider that and you consider the full quarter benefit of the rate hike and where we are, we would expect stable to up modestly in terms of margin, overcoming that two points decline for day count. And we feel much better about our NII growth for the year, which is why we changed our outlook for the entire year to the 4% to 6% range. So we think we're well-positioned to take advantage of not only this past rate increase, but what might be coming in the future, which we have one full rate increase baked into our expectations for remainder of the year","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q18.pdf
question,"Okay. And then with regard to capital deployment in targeted CET1, I know now you're still a pretty high here, obviously did an aggressive asset last year. How close do you think you can approach your 9.5% CET1 target by June 2019?",Steve Moss,Analyst,"B. Riley FBR, Inc.",regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q18.pdf
answer,"June 2019, we can get pretty close by then. We've really been talking about trying to get to 9.5% by the end of this year and we've messaged we can't quite get there but we'll get awful close, I think by the middle of next year. Based on what we know today that we'd be right on top of that. Now things can change. Risk profiles can change. The world can change and that's a long time. But based on our forecast right now, we'd be right on top of it by a year from now.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q18.pdf
question,"Okay. And do you expect the proposed MPR – with the proposed MPR, you could lower your capital target further? David J. Turner, Jr. Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp. A Well, the way we think about it, forget regulatory supervision in that. We set our capital based on how much capital we think we need to run our business appropriately based on the risk profile that we have. It's not about running our capital down as low as we possibly could get it. It's the optimization. It's the right amount for that. And so as risk profiles change up and down, those capital targets will change up and down. What happens in the MPR is it makes it a little easier for us to manage it based on our own capital planning process versus waiting for a non-objection once a year. We do see it as favorable, not having risk-weighted assets increasing. We see it as favorable that you don't have to consider share repurchases in an adverse scenario. So I think this in an adverse scenario. So I think it'll be incrementally helpful. I don't know that that changes how we think about what our target needs to be though.",Steve Moss,Analyst,"B.

question,"Hello. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question up. Maybe staying with that capital point, in the past, you've talked about preferred issuance as a possibility. I mean, does that kind of go away now or is that something that you still might need to do as you bring the CET1 down to the 9.5%?",Geoffrey Elliott,Analyst,Autonomous Research LLP,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q18.pdf
answer,"Yeah. Geoffrey, we've always believed that we need – again optimization is – optimization in terms of total capital and the capital stack that is common and preferred and we've espoused having preferred that's about a 1.5 more than our common equity Tier 1. We've been satisfying that preferred component of the stack with common and that's awful expensive for us. So we see over time that we will trade out some common for preferred and you ought to expect that to happen sometime in 2019 as we get our common equity Tier 1 down closer to that 9.5% level. We're going to have to backfill our Tier 1 with the preferred issuance.","David J.

question,"I'm not sure you guys commented on it in some of the earlier remarks. But just on the securities book, the [indiscernible] (56:48) in the securities book going forward, how should we think about that going from here? It came down a little bit versus the fourth quarter levels and, obviously, also a function of both loan and deposit growth, but how do you think about the levels there going forward?",Matthew Derek O'Connor,Analyst,"Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.",regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q18.pdf
answer,"Yeah, Matt, it's David. I think that if you look at that percentage of earning assets that are in securities, I think that's going to be relatively stable. I do think if things change with [ph] SIFI (57:14) designation and things where LCR aren't as important, you can see the makeup of certain securities changing out. For instance, we're using Ginnie Mae securities to help us on our high quality liquid assets and perhaps we could put those to work a little more effectively for us in time. So I think that we would – we're going to continue to evaluate that and make sure we have an appropriate amount of liquidity, that we have the proper duration in the book and as we continue to grow earning assets, we'll have some portion of that in securities.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q18.pdf

answer,"Yeah I don't think that's – I don't think, Matt, that's fairly meaningful right now. It's not that that much. I do think we have more ability to continue to pick up yield if you will on just the front book rolling off and the back book coming on in terms of investments given the rate environment right now. So we have about $3 billion that will roll out that will help us pick up about 70 – roughly 70 basis points of yield.","David J.

question,"Good. A couple of questions for you. You obviously have very strong credit quality like many of your peers and it was interesting to see that the criticized loans have steadily declined now for over 12 months quite materially. And can you share with us was that energy related where you had to put some on two years ago now they have finally come off or did – and then the second part of that too is did the change in the tax laws in any of your non- performing loans or criticized loans, did the companies get a benefit because of lower taxes and therefore they may have come off the criticized list?",Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q18.pdf
answer,"Yeah, I think I'll ask John Turner to speak in a little more detail but clearly, we had a material exposure to the energy sector and it's taking some time to work through that exposure as well as we had some weather-related exposure because of some hurricanes that came through Texas and through Florida. And so as time has elapsed and the economy has stayed fairly steady, and quite frankly as liquidity has been so available that you've seen an awful lot of the composition of our loan portfolio shift and change and, as you point out, has improved dramatically. But I'll ask John to speak with a little more color in that regard. John Turner President & Head of Corporate Banking Group, Regions Financial Corp. A So, I would say, clearly, we've benefited from some improvement in the energy sector, but I would suggest the improvement is really the results of the focus that we've had on de-risking certain asset classes, certain portfolios over the last two plus years and improving the overall quality of our portfolio. And as we've done that, what we've seen is a significant shift in the quality and at the same time we've had the opportunity to either see companies exit the bank or over time repair because of the work that we've been doing with them. And that's really I think what's had the greatest impact on asset quality as our focus across the bank on de-risking and managing the overall credit quality of our portfolio origination credit quality is much better over the last couple of years as well. And so I think that's what you're saying. With respect to the question about taxes, it's too early I think to have seen any benefit – for our companies that have seen any benefit that would impact credit quality. We certainly would expect that some will experience improved cash flows and that will help us likewise in the energy business. We still have some portion of that portfolio that's adversely rated as prices continue to firm up we see cash flows improve there as well. I think you can expect some additional improvement resulting from the energy portfolio improving over time.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q18.pdf
question,"Thank you. And then as a follow-up changing attack here, you guys gave us some good color on the investments you're making in technology particularly on the consumer side of the business. And there's been a lot of talk about all of the biggest banks spending billions of dollars on technology and how are the regional banks going to compete. The question is, do you look at your technology and the innovations you're making as a competitive advantage or is it really just the ticket to get into the ballpark and to play on the field, you've got to execute? And if you don't have the technology, you're not even going to get into the ballpark rather than that again being your competitive advantage. How do you guys look at it?",Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q18.pdf
answer,"Well, it's a great question and I think one that there's a number of different narratives in the marketplace that are driving fairly substantial technology investments across the industry. I do think that the industry broadly benefits from the investments being made in bank technology. As we said earlier in the meeting, our strategy has not been necessarily leading – on the leading edge of a lot of these technologies, but to be an aggressive follower of proven technologies. We believe that customers enjoy using all of our channels and we see activity across multiple channels by the same customer on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis. And we've tried to work hard on trying to make that a very friendly, consistent experience when a customer comes into one of our branches or comes to a digital channel or an ATM channel. We want them to see the same information and to be able to have the same capabilities across those channels. We think it's making a big difference in our business, but all of our channels are still relevant. I do think you're seeing this narrative about the dollars being spent on technology and that providing some level of competitive advantage. Whether that advantage is sustainable over time really comes back to execution. And we think we're doing a particularly good job of that. We're growing accounts. We're growing households. We're growing balances. We really tried to rationalize the composition of our deposit balance sheet and we've made some tremendous strides in that regard. Really proud of where we're at on deposits today. Very loyal, very granular, have a high customer satisfaction rate and technology is a big part of that but it's not all of it. John, I wouldn't add to that, if you would?","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q18.pdf
answer,"The only thing I would add a couple comments to Grayson, I go back to what I said earlier on the digital and mobile space. We won't spend more than some banks in that space but we look at it through a different lens. And the lens I would look at it from is what are our customers telling us about our channel offers today. If I go back to J.D. Power, again J.D. Power assesses our branch network, ATM network, mobile and online and our call center as well. And when we look at it from a customer standpoint, we're consistently ranked in the top quartile. I think that's to me a more important metric than how many dollars you spend on it. So when we stack up in top quartile and our branch network, our online actually came in number two out of top 23 banks in last quarter. I think that's the lens that we spend more time looking on. As far as innovations and things like that, a couple of things I'd point to, take our remote deposit capture. We were not the first bank to launch remote deposit capture. But what our consumer team did I thought was very innovative which is they came out with a remote deposit capture several years ago that offers a customer choice, and that choice is around when do they get credit for that deposit? Is it immediate and they can pay for that and get immediate credit which is great for small businesses that are looking for cash flow or they can do standard which is a free deposit. So things like that we're not going to be first but we can improve on what we're doing there. The other one I'd point out would be AI. There's a lot of discussion and talk about AI in the market. We've been working with it now for over a year. In our contact center, we're using AI for our agents to be able to really chat with IBM Watson and answer customers' questions quicker in a more accurate way. And there are things like that that we're doing, they're just happening behind the scenes but we are innovating.",John B. Owen,Senior Executive Vice President & Head-Regional Banking Group,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q18.pdf
answer,"Thank you, John.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q18.pdf
question,"Very good. And if I could just squeeze one more in though, Grayson, because of your background, when you look at technology, we start back with the mainframes and then we went to minicomputers and then micros and then the Internet, now digital AI. Can you share with us from your experience how revolutionary – is the one we're going through right now the biggest of them all or no, you remember 25 years ago, it was even bigger?",Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q18.pdf
answer,"Yeah, it all depends on how you measure it. Obviously, this industry spent an awful lot on technology over the last two or three decades and really has sort of transformed how we serve customers and how we comply with regulation in compliance and how we analyze risk and how we extend credit. It just transformed every part of our business. And I would say that for the most part, it's gotten better, faster, cheaper every year. Probably the largest transformation that has occurred has been the mobile phone. That mobile device, that mobile smartphone just really has been the largest game changer I saw in my career being involved in fin technology because early on computing was too heavy to carry in a mobile phone and it was relatively slow and extremely expensive. And we've seen that really come down over the years and so the cost of storing data, the cost of computing data has really improved. It's made it available to most of our population and so it's changed the way we serve customers. The question is how much value, how much sustainable value do you achieve as a bank by investing in technology? I do believe you have to continue to invest, but as we've seen, computing becomes less expensive over time. And so you have to keep innovating, keep investing to I think to stay competitive and serve your customers in the right way. But I still believe the basics haven't changed as the people who win are real smart about what technologies they pick and they're really good at implementing and executing that strategy. And so I think, the execution is a much bigger question than how many dollars you spent last year. Dollars matter but execution determines who sustains a competitive advantage.","O. B.

answer,"Good morning, Ken.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
question,"Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks. David, just on your comments about the outlook for the changing rate environment and the potential pressures that brings forth, can you talk through where that manifests itself the most, is it the investment portfolio, is it loan spreads and if you could go a little bit further into that ability to kind of remix those deposits as you move through the year? Thanks.",Ken Usdin,Analyst,Jefferies LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
answer,"Sure, Ken. So, yeah, we've looked at the rate environment clearly changed since going into the year, not anything different than we've experienced before. As we showed you at Investor Day, we had a three-year outlook, if rates were lower than we thought and we adapted and overcame that, and we'll do it again this time. As we think about rates from a reinvestment standpoint, we still have a front book, back book benefit. It's not as much as it was originally, but we still benefit from that. This particular quarter, we had a couple of things that impacted us. We had loan growth that was a little stronger than we had anticipated with 160 basis point increase in line utilization. We had to fund that and we chose to fund that with higher cost deposits versus going to the wholesale market. So if you look at deposit betas, that caused our deposit beta to be up. Our overall funding beta is kind of in line with peers. But we thought that was the right thing to do. The loans that we've put on were a little thinner spread, which put a little pressure on our margin. The margin actually was impacted by our parent company debt issuance we had in the first quarter as well as a reclassification of purchasing card assets that don't carry any interest carry. Those two things were 2 basis points of margin in the quarter. So as we look forward, what we need to do is continue to remix the balance sheet, both on the loan side and the deposit side, as we seek to optimize both levels to get our net interest income where we want it to be and the resulting margin. I will go ahead and answer the question because it's probably coming up that our margin expectation for the year we believe to be commensurate with what we had last year, in the 3.50% range, give or take a point or two. So that's how we see the rates and our expectation for the year.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
question,"Got it, okay. And then one follow-up on the loans, you've reiterated that with a good start to the loan growth, the adjusted loan growth, can you give us an idea of just the summary of the non-core – the combination of the auto stuff and then the new loans you sold and what you expect that would be on the full year? Thanks, David.",Ken Usdin,Analyst,Jefferies LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
answer,"So we're still guiding on the adjusted loans that carves out the run-off portfolios to be in the low single digits. You'll see some of the remixing there. A little bit of that growth that you saw in the first quarter, where companies that have access to the capital markets that chose to come to the bank market because it's cheaper, we expect that to change over time. And so you should expect some run-off there, and we'll refill that still to get our low single-digit growth. The auto book continues to run down. We'll be in the $700 million – $800 million range on those run-off portfolios.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf

answer,"Good morning, John.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
question,"Good morning. Just on that point, on the deposit and margin commentary there, given the loan growth you saw in the quarter, you said it came in a little bit better. Why did you make the decision to fund that growth with higher- cost funding versus deposits?",John Pancari,Analyst,Evercore Group LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
answer,"No, what I said was we chose to fund that with higher-cost deposits versus wholesale funding, because the deposit growth was cheaper than what funding was. And what I was trying to address is the deposit beta was negatively impacted because of that decision. If you look at our total funding beta, our total funding beta was fairly consistent with the peers. So it's just a mix of what we chose to fund that growth with versus what somebody else might have done.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
question,"Okay, thank you. And I misunderstood it. I just wanted to get clarity on that. Okay, and then separately, around the loan growth expectation for the year and that you expect it to slow from here, could you just talk about some of the give and takes about what you think will drive to the net moderation off of this level versus any incremental strengthening on the commercial side, for example?",John Pancari,Analyst,Evercore Group LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
answer,"So as John mentioned in his comments, we feel good about – our customers feel good about the economy, and they're continuing to borrow. That increase we saw, part of that this first quarter again were customers we believe have access, we know have access to the capital markets that chose to use their bank lines of credit to give them more flexibility in terms of timing on when they would go to the capital market system. It's just a matter of time before that happens. So we're going to see those loans run out of the bank as we continue to grow consistent with our expectations at the beginning of the year. So when you get net-net to the end of the year, we think net loan growth is still in the low single digits.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
question,"Okay. Thanks, David. And one last thing on credit, can you just give us a bit of color around the drivers of the higher classified and special mention loans, and I guess your thought around the longer-term loan loss reserve level here? I know it stands around 1.01%. I wanted to get your thoughts on where that could trend to.",John Pancari,Analyst,Evercore Group LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
answer,"Certainly, John. It's Barb Godin. Relative to criticized and classified, in terms of those numbers, that's attributable to really two or three credits that moved over. And given the lows that we're on, it's simply starting to slowly normalize. Also recall that our results include the results of the recently completed Shared National Credit survey, or credit exam, so that's all-encompassing. We don't see any trends in there that we're looking at that concern us at all at this point. And in terms of our loan loss reserve, we're sitting at 1.01%. We think that area, 1% – 1.01%, is probably the right number as we look forward as well until we get to CECL next year.",Barbara I. Godin,"Executive Vice President, Consumer Banking Credit Executive",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
question,"Got it. Thank you, Barb.",John Pancari,Analyst,Evercore Group LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
answer,"John, I would just reiterate that. I think we still feel very good about our credit metrics. As Barb said, we're really at better than 10-year lows in terms of criticized, classified, and non-performing loans. And so from time to time, we're going to see a little movement up or down, I think, in those metrics. In this particular quarter, as Barb mentioned, we had one or two credits that impacted both criticized loans and non-performing loans. And so given the low base we're coming off, I think you're going to see some back-and-forth there over the coming quarters as credit begins to normalize a bit, but we feel still very good about our credit quality.","John M.

question,"I just had a question on your capital target. I know you mentioned that with the expectation that you have for buyback this coming year, you should be able to get to 9.5% target CET1. I'm just wondering if given the proposal that that has for its NPR that's outstanding out there for banks your size, would you be at all rethinking the target CET1 at any point or is that something that you think you need to have as high as 9.5% going forward?",Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
answer,"Betsy, we had mentioned at Investor Day that mathematically our capital that we think we need based on the risk profile that we have would lead one to a Common Equity Tier 1 of 9% and we said to those attending and listened that we added another 50 basis points of cushion on that. We believe that that capital level, one, provides the proper capital we need to have, plus a little bit, while allowing us to get to our return expectations that we also laid out. So, those targets were not derived based on supervisory input or the CCAR mechanism. So I don't see that changing at all. As you know, we have to get through the second quarter which is based on last year's submission and in the third quarter, we'll start – we're not under CECL, but it'll start our capital plan. And that's why we have confidence we will get to our 9.5% by the end and we'll have – we'll be able to toggle between loan growth and share buybacks as we seek to manage the capital at that level.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
question,"Okay. It just seems very – there's a lot of cushion in there, so I'm wondering maybe it reflects the view that you feel your portfolio might be a little more risky than peers or you're just super conservative?",Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
answer,"Well, as I mentioned, our math, based on our risk profile, would lead you to 9%. We choose to have an extra 50 basis points in there which we think gives us flexibility especially as you think about where we are in a 10-year run. And if the economy were to turn down, we have the ability to perhaps take advantage of some opportunities that might come our way to invest in the assets that could give us growth. So it's – we think an appropriate amount of cushion because it did weigh us down from our return objectives and gives us that flexibility. So that's why we do it.","David J.

question,"Hi, good morning.",Erika Najarian,Analyst,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
answer,"Good morning, Erika.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
answer,"Good morning, Erika.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
question,"Good morning. I wanted to follow-up on the comments on capital actions. So, if we filled in the template that the Fed distributed, we're getting to about a max pre-approved capital action of about $2.15 billion for 3Q 2019 to 2Q 2020. And I'm wondering if that's ballpark with how your team calculated the template?",Erika Najarian,Analyst,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
answer,"Well, I think, again, the way we want you to get there is by looking at our target of Common Equity Tier 1 of 9.5%. We think that the toggle we have to think through on buyback is what's loan growth going to look like? We've said we want to payout a dividend in the 35% to 45% range, so that uses a piece of it, of earnings. And then the rest of it is either going to be used for loan growth or it's going for the most part or we're going to buy shares back. So trying to now stipulate exactly what that buyback is going to be is, one, we don't think it's necessary as much because we're giving you what the end result is going to be. So you have to come up with your expectation of what our loan growth is going to be, help you get your buyback number.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
question,"Oh, I meant all-in. Okay. And just taking a step back, you unveiled a mid-term efficiency ratio of 55% or below during your Investor Day. And, of course, the curve dynamics have gotten less friendly since. I'm wondering as we think through the next few years, is there that much expense leverage left to be able to get you to this target of less than 55% by 2021 with this type of curve backdrop, or are we underestimating some of the investments that you're making that could boost revenue beyond rates beyond 2019?",Erika Najarian,Analyst,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
answer,"Yeah, Erika, I would say it's a combination of both. First of all, we're committed to 55% efficiency ratio by the end of 2021. And we believe we have appropriate levers both in terms of revenue growth from investments we're making and opportunities to reduce expenses to be reinvested in additional initiatives that will help generate revenue growth to get to the 55% efficiency ratio. We're absolutely committed to get there. Erika Najarian Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch Q Okay, got it. Thank you.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
answer,"Good morning, Matt.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
question,"Hi. I'm wondering. Where do market rates have to go to flatten out the NIM? Obviously, you're guiding to flattish NIM on a full-year basis, but trickling down from the 1Q level. And just conceptually, and I realize that 10-year is not the only rate that matters, but what's the breakeven point on the 10-year, where does it flatten out I think at 3.53% versus trickle down?",Matthew Derek O'Connor,Analyst,"Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.",regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
answer,"If you think about the 10-year just on reinvestment on the securities book, so we're coming off a 2.70%-ish range, reinvesting in the 2.90% to 3% range, so we're getting some lift just reinvesting those cash flows over the near term. It's really not curve dynamics as much that drives versus the mix of what we put on both on the right and left side of the balance sheet. So I think you could have – you could be where rates are in the curve, if you look where it is now and depending on what your choices are would depend on whether or not you continue to grow NII and resulting margin or whether it stays flat. We're looking to optimize our balance sheet for not only NIM, but net interest income growth, return, credit risk management, all that has to work together. And again, we've laid out our three-year expectations and our one-year expectation, and we intend to hit all of that. So, there are a lot of moving parts that you have to deal with and that's a hard one to explain.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
question,"Okay. No, I understand. Just I think what's changed versus a few months ago is the rate environment versus I think your strategy, and obviously rates, they move around and were up 20 bps off the bottom and maybe two months from now will be 20 bps higher [indiscernible] (00:32:49).",Matthew Derek O'Connor,Analyst,"Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.",regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
answer,"Matt, I'd add, our expectation were that rates were going to go down at some point, which is why we began our hedging program over a year ago. As we've mentioned, we're about 75% through our hedging program right now and we did that in large part with forward-starting swaps to begin in 2020 as we expected GDP to decline to 2.5% in 2019, 2% in 2020 and 1% in 2021, and that the probability of rate cuts would increase in 2020 and 2021 and we want to be protected there. What you've seen of late is a reversal from the Fed and it put more pressure on not getting – not only not getting an increase this year, but having some probability of a cut this year, which we don't think will happen by the way. And so, that's really where we're more exposed is, if there were a cut right now, again, we'll take that risk because we don't believe that will happen.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
question,Okay.,Matthew Derek O'Connor,Analyst,"Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.",regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
answer,"The other point, I guess, I'd make just if I might on balance sheet optimization is, as we've indicated, we think that loan growth will begin to moderate a bit. At the same time, our core deposit base continues to grow very consistently. Consumer demand deposits grew over 4% last year. They're growing for the seventh year in a row, point to point, up about 7%. We see growth in consumer savings, consumer checking continues to grow. And so that's a more consistent, deliberate increase in deposits that will occur over time. And as that catches up with loan growth which we'll be moderating, we have an opportunity to also optimize our deposit base, and we think that will accrue to our benefit.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
question,"Okay. I guess the optimization and the mix that you're talking about, I thought would have been beneficial to NIM.",Matthew Derek O'Connor,Analyst,"Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.",regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
answer,Yes.,"John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
question,Okay. But the combination of that and where we are on rates still causes it to trickle down a little bit.,Matthew Derek O'Connor,Analyst,"Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.",regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
answer,"Well, I think you could have some noise in the interim, again, we're at 3.53%. We said we'd be at 3.50% for the year, give or take a point or two. And it's going to be dependent on how well we optimize. And the 10 years move quite rapidly, it's gone from 3.50% to almost 3.60%. We're down a little bit this morning. So if – we continue to – the tenure continues to move up a little bit and the reinvestment helps us to increase net interest income and helps us from a mortgage standpoint.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
question,"Got it. And then, if you don't mind, I just want to squeeze in the line utilization increase of 160 basis points. Was that concentrated in like a handful of credits? And if not, I guess, what makes you think it's going to decline so much to meaningfully slow the loan growth that was so good this quarter? Thank you.",Matthew Derek O'Connor,Analyst,"Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.",regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
answer,"Matt, I'll ask Ronnie Smith, who heads our Corporate Bank, to answer the question. Ronnie? Ronald G. Smith Senior Executive Vice President & Head of Corporate Banking Group, Regions Financial Corp. A Yeah. Matt, it was very broad based. It was not in a handful of clients, and really focused in on most of our higher quality clients that I think David mentioned earlier that have access to other markets and we are anticipating that we'll see changes with those advanced rates as we go forward, but very broad based across industries and within geographies as well.","John M.

answer,"Good morning, Jennifer.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
question,"Thank you. Hi, good morning. Question on credit, Barb, two questions. First of all, I assume you're running parallel right now. I'm wondering if you have any preliminary estimates on what the day-one impact will be for CECL. My second question is on your criticized leverage loans. That slide was very helpful in the deck. Is there any industry concentration within those criticized leverage credits? That's it.",Jennifer Demba,Analyst,"SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.",regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
answer,"First question on CECL is yes, we are in the midst of doing a lot of work, running parallel, making sure our models are operating the way they need to, et cetera. We'll probably disclose something in the second quarter, but we're not quite ready to do that yet on the CECL front. Relative to the leveraged loans, et cetera, there's nothing that sticks out in terms of anything that's an anomaly, so a pretty good book.",Barbara I. Godin,"Executive Vice President, Consumer Banking Credit Executive",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
answer,"Just for clarification, I think in our second quarter release probably we'll provide some information on third quarter release, day-one impact, so we're still a ways off.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
answer,"It will be in the third quarter release, something. We want to run parallel for a couple quarters and see what it looks like.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
question,"Great, thank you so much.",Jennifer Demba,Analyst,"SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.",regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
answer,"Good morning, Marty.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
question,"David, I wanted to – hey, good morning. Talk to you a little bit about NII versus net interest margin. When you had a little bit of extra loan growth this quarter and then you went out and funded it, you literally could have funded it through the securities portfolio, which would have increased your net interest margin just by substituting higher rate assets – loans, being investment securities. So I think the temporary nature of what you did or thought your loan growth is going to have and since the run up is going to come back down, you just went out and funded it, which incrementally caused some pressure on your net interest margin. And then if you look at NII, it's still growing relatively nice year over year, but you had the day count in the first quarter. So it just seems like to me the margin this quarter was exacerbated just given all in the incremental funding of the balance sheet.",Marty Mosby,Analyst,Vining Sparks IBG LP,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
answer,"Marty, so the NIM to us is the result of all the things that we do. And you're exactly right, what we put on – if we wanted to be fixated on our NIM, we could have done different things. I do want to make sure if I caught the fact that our NIM was impacted 1 basis point by our parent company issuance, and then we had the reclassification of our purchasing card into loans, which is a non-interest-bearing asset, so that weighed us down another point. So we could have kept the margin relatively stable at 3.55%, but we were able to keep NII level notwithstanding two days which cost us $10 million in the quarter, so we thought it was pretty good. Again, we'll optimize the balance sheet. And those loans that we did – certain of those loans we put on had thinner spreads to them, they'll run after the capital markets, we'll get a capital markets fee when that happens, we'll remix the balance sheet and we'll be off to the races. So we're not overly fixated on the margin.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
question,"That's what I thought. And then you talked about deposit betas and you said that through-the-cycle the cumulative beta right now is about 25%. And you said by the time we're done, we're going to be at 30%. Now that would, in general, assume that you had further rate hikes that then were going to push deposit rates up. But if we stabilize here and rates don't go up any more, let's just assume that they don't, wouldn't deposit pricing, maybe with a little bit till increase in the second quarter begin to kind of flatten out, so I just want to make sure we were being consistent with how much of the excess you expected in deposit pricing going forward.",Marty Mosby,Analyst,Vining Sparks IBG LP,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
answer,"So what our history tells us is that it takes about 12 months and change after the last Fed hike for deposit rates to stop moving. So that's a piece of this that you just – even if we don't get another increase, you'll see that continuing to come through. Mix has a big deal to do with it too. So as we continue to grow low-cost core checking accounts and interest-free accounts, that's helpful. But our commercial customers want to – they're trying to take their excess cash and get the best yield that they can. If rates stop moving, that will abate too. So moving up into the 30s, we could argue where in the 30s we might end up. The point is we're going to continue to see some cost, some funding cost increases continuing to come through that we need to deal with. And we have a little bit of headwind on reinvestment on the left side of the balance sheet, and then the optimization really will carry the day for us.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
question,"And then I guess the thing that I would suggest or highlight is that this deposit beta market has not been like any historical period we've seen in the past. It's been a lot different, and it's actually reacted much better than what we've seen in the past. So why should we expect that maybe we could see this thing slow down or actually begin to flatten out a lot quicker given that the deposit betas have been better than what we've seen in the past cycles?",Marty Mosby,Analyst,Vining Sparks IBG LP,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
answer,"You're certainly correct that it's different. Betas last time were in the 60% range, and now we're talking in the 30% range.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
question,Right.,Marty Mosby,Analyst,Vining Sparks IBG LP,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
answer,"And part of that is because of how slow this recovery has been and the pace of those increases. You're also coming off historic lows. And so I think all that matters, and there is a chance that things flatten out quicker than we have anticipated. If that happens, then we're going to be better off than we think, and we'd much rather give you a number that we can hit versus trying to promise something that we'll struggle achieving.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
question,"And then just last question, the swaps next year, is there any net increase in earnings from the spread lock-in, if rates were flat, given the fixed rate that you locked-in, is there – it should be a little bit of a positive spread. So I was just curious if there is some upcoming income that you're going to get out of those swaps once they actually hit the forward dates, and when does that actually happen? Thanks.",Marty Mosby,Analyst,Vining Sparks IBG LP,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
answer,"So the forward dates are in 2020, and you're right, we would have some positive carry there, but we also entered into some interest rate floors where you have to pay a premium and you amortize premium. So, the amortization unfortunately offsets the swap benefit. So again, if rates didn't move from here, we kind of push there...","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
question,Got you.,Marty Mosby,Analyst,Vining Sparks IBG LP,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf

question,"Hey, good morning, everyone.",Stephen Kendall Scouten,Analyst,Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
answer,Good morning.,"John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
question,"I'm curious just digging down on the NIM a little bit further, obviously, at Investor Day, you laid out this range of 3.40% to 3.70%. And by the commentary from you, David, that we might get to 3.50% for the year implies that the NIM will move into high 3.40s by year-end. So, can you talk to me a little bit about how that lower end, even in a zero policy range scenario, would only get down to 3.40%, and maybe what dynamics have changed since 2016 when we were at 3.15%, 3.16%, that sort of range?",Stephen Kendall Scouten,Analyst,Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
answer,"Yeah. So part of what we want to do is try to frame up the range at Investor Day like we did which changed since then was the near-term risk before our forward-starting swaps began in 2020. So even if you saw a dip in 2019, we actually start recovering that in 2020 when our derivatives kick in. So, that's the piece that gives us confidence that we're still within the range that we told you back then. If we received a rate cut in 2019, that would – we'd have a different ballgame, we'd be telling you something different. We just don't think the probability is very high that that happens. So anyway, that's – did I get... [indiscernible] (00:45:45)","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
question,"Yeah, that's a perfect answer. Thank you. And the swaps are really what prevents you from getting down into those levels we saw back in 2016 even if we were to revert back to a similar rate environment?",Stephen Kendall Scouten,Analyst,Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
answer,That's exactly right.,"David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
question,"Okay. And then just lastly, on the securities book, is there any chance that you guys look to reduce that as a percentage of average earning assets to fund some of the growth or is that kind of 22% range where you'd like to stay?",Stephen Kendall Scouten,Analyst,Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
answer,"I think there, we have a little bit in there that's helping part of our hedging program right now that works against us again on our margin. It's not a tremendously large number. We kind of like where we are from that standpoint. I think what you should expect over time is a remixing of our securities book. Today, we still have treasuries and Ginnie Maes in there that we used for LCR purposes, and to the extent that changes and maybe we can put those working a little more effectively for us into mortgage backs. So you'll see us do that from time to time. As a matter of fact, you saw us take security losses this quarter to pair off with a gain that we had on selling the affordable mortgage loans so that we could get better carry going forward and we'll pay for that in less than a year. So, those are the kinds of things you should expect us to do over time.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
question,"Perfect, thanks so much.",Stephen Kendall Scouten,Analyst,Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
question,"Hey. Hey, guys. A quick – I just wanted to follow-up on the line of questioning on the deposit betas and actually just want to make sure I understand the math kind, what you guys are saying. So, the 25% through-the-cycle beta thus far basically implies that your deposit costs have moved up in the neighborhood of about 55 basis points, given where the Fed funds is at right now. If I assume no further hikes and you get to low-30s, that implies an additional 15 basis points to 20 basis points of deposit cost pressure over the next 12 months. Is my math more or less right? Is that what you're kind of baking into that assumption?",Saul Martinez,Analyst,UBS Securities LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
answer,"Yeah. I think you're close, just probably closer to 10 basis points, but we're at 46 basis points of cost, one of the lowest. So when you start looking at beta and percentages, you can get some odd numbers, but we feel like – again back to, I think as Marty asked a question, if we miss it, we're going to outperform what we're telling you.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
question,"Got it. It's closer – I'm sorry, it's closer to 10 basis points is what you're kind of baking in in terms of incremental deposit cost pressure without any further hikes.",Saul Martinez,Analyst,UBS Securities LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
answer,That's right. That's right.,"David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
question,Is that on total deposit or interest-bearing?,Saul Martinez,Analyst,UBS Securities LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
answer,Those are really more interest-bearing.,"David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
question,"Interest-bearing, okay. I want to make sure I got that math. And then I guess on the – just a broader question, the 2% to 4% revenue, I know you've talked about NIMs and NIM sort of stabilizing at 3.5% for the full year or being at 3.5% for the full year. But the 2% to 4% revenue growth, how do we think about that in terms of your NII growth versus fee growth?",Saul Martinez,Analyst,UBS Securities LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
answer,"We kind of put those together, Saul, this time, because obviously there's challenges in terms of managing earning assets and the mix and all that. So we've put that together within AR, we're still convicted that will be within 2% to 4%. Right now, there's more pressure on the NII component of that, but not enough that would cause us to not meet that goal that we had.","David J.

Are you comfortable with these levels or we're talking a year from now, are these numbers going to be much different than they are today?",Gerard S. Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
answer,"No, I don't think so, Gerard. And I'll let maybe Barb speak as well, but I think we've established some internal limits, just as we have concentration limits for lots of other aspects of the way we manage risk in our portfolio. And we are at a level with respect to leverage lending that we are comfortable with. We expect to continue to manage, too, about the level that we're at. I think the most risky exposure we've talked about before in the portfolio has been loans to sponsor owned companies. We brought that down from kind of the mid-30% to somewhere in the 26%, 27% range as I recall, and we'll continue to work on that to ensure that the leverage exposure that we do have is to customers that we have full relationships with, that it's in industries that we know well, distributed across a variety of different industries. So we don't have any real concentrated exposure by industry sector either. And I think we do feel comfortable with it. But I'll let Barb respond to that question as well.","John M.

answer,"The only thing I have to add is, just as you said, these are to our best quality C&I customers that we do leverage lending to, in particular. So we are very comfortable with them. We look at them on a regular basis. We look at the book on a monthly basis and we recycle if we see something that either is not carrying its weight or that we feel that it's probably a good opportunity for us to move out of, we take immediate action on it.

Can you share with us how that is progressing and how do we as outsiders determine whether you're being successful in those markets?",Gerard S. Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_1Q19.pdf
answer,"Well, we think it's progressing well. We have about 40 de novo branches that are now open and operating, I guess, for less than a year, largely across those markets. We continue to reposition our retail franchise. As an example, in St. Louis, as we shift that franchise and we shared this with you at Investor Day, I think we now have access to 10% more households, more wealth, more businesses, the same would be true as we think about expansion in Atlanta. I think we now have access to more than 1 million more or nearly 1 million more customer, households, businesses and wealth. And so those opportunities continue to be available to us. Year-over-year, checking growth, about 15% of our growth is attributable to de novos. And so we'll continue to look for ways to provide you all with some information like the percentage of growth attributable to de novos as an example that'll give you some sense of how we're doing. I think, again, core to our strategy is looking for ways to continue to grow our core customer base. So as we're growing consumer checking accounts, as we're growing debit card usage, as we're growing credit cards on the consumer side, as we're growing small business accounts and small business deposit balances, those should be indicators to you that our expansion strategy is gaining some traction. We're recruiting talent in those markets and feel good about the teams we continue to build. And all in all, I think we're going to continue to on the path to execute that strategy.","John M.

question,"On the loan growth front, wanted to see if you can give us a bit more color on where you see the drivers of loan growth through the back half coming from and your full-year outlook of low-single digits. It seems like at this point, you might be trending at the lower-end of that. Do you see it that way or do you think it can break to the upside a little bit through the back half? Thanks.",John Pancari,Analyst,Evercore Group LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q18.pdf
answer,"Well, I would say, first of all, we are affirming our current guidance for low-single-digit loan growth excluding the runoff that's targeted in indirect portfolio and the TDR sale obviously. If I focus on the consumer side of the business, we feel pretty good about our forecast. We look at mortgage, we expect it to generally be flat, I think. We see runoff in the HELOC portfolio and the balance of our consumer business should grow modestly, we believe, across most of the sectors in the remaining part of the year. On the corporate side of the business, our pipelines are good. They have improved since the first quarter and they continue to be pretty solid. Our customers are optimistic, but I would say, they're still a bit cautious. We're seeing customers use a lot of their liquidity to fund their additional borrowing needs or what would have traditionally been additional borrowing needs and you can see that in some of our runoff in our deposit balances. But generally, if you think about our business in the three segments that we think about, the corporate banking business, I think, will grow modestly through the balance of the year, largely as a result of activity within our Specialized Industries group and a more narrow targeted focus by our diversified industry bankers. And we've seen both those teams have some success in the first part of the year. In the traditional middle market, commercial banking and smaller business banking, we have a renewed focus there that we're beginning to see really get some traction. Owner-occupied real estate, which had been running off at a pretty rapid rate through, I guess, over the last 10 years has really begun to slow and that will help us, we believe, see some additional loan growth through the balance of the year. And then, finally, in real estate, we had indicated we thought, in the second quarter, we would begin to see some modest growth. If you remember that we had been de-risking that portfolio, exiting many of the multi-family construction loans that we had on the books and that has been successful, I think. Term lending, while it's very competitive, has begun to have a positive impact on our portfolio. And so, we saw some nice loan growth at the end of the quarter in real estate banking. And so, all-in-all, I think our guidance is solid. I would not say that we, at this point, would guide toward the upper- end of the range. I think it would be lower-end to the middle of the range, but we do believe that we will achieve those objectives. And if we do, we will meet all of our other targets as a result of that.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer, Director & Member-Operating Committee and Executive Council",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q18.pdf
question,"Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. Then, in terms of your margin, saw some pretty good expansion again this quarter and probably would have even been higher, if not for the leveraged lease transaction, but I just want to – or the impairment that is. I want to get your updated thoughts on the sensitivity to the ongoing Fed moves, but also rising betas. What's your updated sensitivity to each incremental 25-basis-point Fed hike?",John Pancari,Analyst,Evercore Group LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q18.pdf
answer,"Yeah. I think, John, so, this is David, our expectation for the year is – our beta, thus far, is 14%, as I mentioned earlier. We do think that picks up in the back half of the year, but if we look at 2018, we think of beta in the 30% range is what's baked into the guidance that we've given you. Thus far, we've outperformed our expectation on beta and rates have come in faster than we had anticipated as well. And so, we're reiterating our guidance on net interest income growth this year to the higher-end of that 4% to 6% range. We think we can get the higher-end of that. As it relates to next quarter, we think we'll have another solid quarter of growth in NII and we think our margin will grow modestly, because it has to overcome about 2 points for the next quarter for the head count. So, I think that we feel very good about our expectations.","David J.

question,Thank you. Just wondering if you could clarify what your M&A interest and capacity is at this point.,Jennifer Demba,Analyst,"SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.",regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q18.pdf
answer,"Sure. We have an M&A team and they're charged with finding both bank and non-bank opportunities. And we've had some success acquiring non-bank businesses, mortgage servicing rights and other loan portfolios. In fact, we point to BlackArch Partners and that investment as being a real high point in the quarter in terms of their contribution. And we'll continue to look for those kinds of opportunities, because non-bank opportunities help us fill gaps in our capabilities, meet customer needs and importantly, grow and diversify revenue. Bank M&A is a good bit more challenging. When we think about where Regions trade relative to our peers, we're trading – or relative to targets, I would say, likely targets, we're trading at a discount. And as a result, the economics just don't work for us. We look at our plans and our opportunities and we think they are significant. We benefit from rising rates. We have a good plan to return capital to our shareholders, which should generate outsized returns. We think, through our Simplify and Grow initiative that there's a real opportunity to improve our core business. And so, we're just not going to do a transaction that would be significantly dilutive to our shareholders in this environment. Now that's not to say that we're not going to continue to look, we will do that, we learn as we do, but I think we're going to be very conservative and very thoughtful. We'll seek to build relationships with potential sellers. We'll watch the market, but we're going to be very disciplined in that regard, principally because, again, we have the opportunity we think to take advantage of a number of other levers that will drive outsized returns for our shareholders.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer, Director & Member-Operating Committee and Executive Council",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q18.pdf
question,Great. Thank you for the update.,Jennifer Demba,Analyst,"SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.",regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q18.pdf
question,"Hi. Thanks, guys. In terms of the balance sheet mix, you haven't had a lot of earning asset growth, which has allowed you to be, I think, in part so disciplined on the deposit side. How much more shrinkage do you think you could see in terms of the non-interest-bearing deposit side? And at what point do you think that you might have to just go out into the market just to keep up with what hopefully is now a better trajectory on the loan growth side?",Ken Usdin,Analyst,Jefferies LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q18.pdf
answer,"Yeah Ken, this is David. So, you mentioned us being disciplined on pricing on the deposit side, but I would tell you, we've been very disciplined on the left side of the balance sheet. We want to grow loans. We did grow loans this quarter, but we are going to remain very disciplined in making sure that when we lay our capital to our customers to serve their needs that we are paid and we have an appropriate return on that capital that we put out. We have a low loan deposit ratio relative to our peers and staying disciplined on the left side of balance sheet lets us be even more disciplined on the right side. You are correct to see that non-interest-bearing deposits have been put to work. A lot of that has been on the corporate banking side, where corporate banking customers are looking for alternatives to generate yield. Some of that's gone into interest-bearing accounts with us. Some of that's been utilized, as John mentioned earlier, to fund capital expenditures and put the excess cash to work, but at some point, we believe those actions will dissipate and we'll be able to grow loans. We are constantly looking for relationship deposits. Whether it'd be on the consumer side or the business service side, that will always be important to us, but we don't see any need in the near term to have to go out and bid up deposits from a cost standpoint. That being said, we do have promotions like others do and we'll look at opportunities to strengthen the market, leveraging that, but wholesale changes in our deposit structure is not in order at this point.","David J. Turner, Jr.","Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Member-Executive Council and Operating Committee",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q18.pdf
answer,"Yeah. And I'd just make another – maybe two points, Ken. One is if you look at growth in consumer deposits, we grew demand deposits in the consumer business by 6.4% year-over-year and continue to see good growth in checking accounts and households. And so, we believe that we'll see nice steady growth in consumer deposits. The second thing I'd say is we are, again, reiterating our guidance for low-single-digit deposit growth through the end of the year. And so, we do expect that we'll continue to grow deposits and finish the year with a little growth.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer, Director & Member-Operating Committee and Executive Council",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q18.pdf
question,"Understood. Okay. Thanks, guys.",Ken Usdin,Analyst,Jefferies LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q18.pdf
question,"Good morning. On the commercial real estate growth here, I was just wondering we've heard more comments around competition and tighter spreads, wondering what you guys have seen as it relates to that and what types of properties are driving growth.",Steve Moss,Analyst,"B. Riley FBR, Inc.",regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q18.pdf
answer,"Yeah. So, a great question. We are seeing a lot of competition. Particularly in that term lending product, spreads that compressed 50 basis points or more since the beginning of the year. We've had to be very selective in seeking out opportunities in this space. The growth we've had, though modest, has been in multi-family and office primarily where we think we have a good expertise. Just mind of the audience that we have been managing that portfolio very actively for quite some time and today, it represents about 7% of our total loan portfolio down from at one time, Barb?","John M.

answer,30%.,"David J. Turner, Jr.","Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Member-Executive Council and Operating Committee",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q18.pdf
answer,"In the 30% range back during the crisis. So, we believe it's a business that we can and will continue to grow modestly. It provides really nice fee income opportunities for us and you see that in our capital markets business and it improving, also presents an opportunity for us to grow deposits as we begin to develop more relationships with the owner-operator customer who is the term lending customer. So, we'll grow it modestly, but carefully, and again manage it, I think, very judiciously.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer, Director & Member-Operating Committee and Executive Council",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q18.pdf
question,"Okay. That's helpful. And then, on the securities portfolio here, wondering what your thoughts are on balances going forward as the yield curve has narrowed. And what are your thoughts, if it inverts you in next couple of quarters?",Steve Moss,Analyst,"B. Riley FBR, Inc.",regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q18.pdf
answer,"Yeah. So, in terms of the level of securities as a percentage of earning assets, we don't anticipate any significant change there. If we do get some liquidity, LCR relief, we may change out some Ginnie Mae securities and put them to work more effectively. But right now, we think that just continuing to manage the book like we are with the same duration. We have a lift coming from our fixed rate lending and our securities book even if rates stay flat to where they are right now as we rerate some $12 million to $14 billion worth of assets over a given year. So, an inversion, that you spoke of, we think would be more central bank driven than a precursor to a downturn. And even with that, as rates have shifted up and the repricing comes through, we still have a very significant tailwind to help us continue growing NII.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer, Director & Member-Operating Committee and Executive Council",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q18.pdf
question,Okay. Thank you very much.,Steve Moss,Analyst,"B. Riley FBR, Inc.",regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q18.pdf
question,"Hi. Good morning, everybody. I wanted to ask about the loan yield. Your C&I yield, obviously, picked up with the higher rates, but significantly less, I think, than a lot of other banks, who benefited from this blowing out of LIBOR relative to the Fed Funds rate. Maybe the leverage lease trend write-down had, maybe on the margin, something to do with it. But I'm curious why you're not seeing a bit more of a yield pickup as some of your competitors have and does it have to do with hedging strategy? Does it have to do with the structure? But it's been, over the last few quarters, about 10 bps sequential with every rate hike. So, I'm curious why – if there's something there that is different about your C&I book or how you manage through the portfolio.",Saul Martinez,Analyst,UBS Securities LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q18.pdf
answer,"Yeah. I'll take a shot at that and maybe David can follow. Typically, I mean, our C&I business has been very much a relationship-oriented business. Going back a very long time, it's generally built around our core markets, Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, where we have very long and deep relationships. We enjoy significant demand deposits associated with those relationships in that business. And while we don't – as we look at our peers typically, don't get the same yield on the loan side of our business, we enjoy, we think, greater demand deposits. And so, view it from a relationship perspective, we think that there's fair tradeoff there. That's part of it. Another part of it is that we have been seeking to grow both our government and institutional banking business, which is a little more competitive and yields are narrower. And separately, we've been working hard to stem the tide of runoff in our owner-occupied real estate portfolio. And so, deals there have been compressed a bit too.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer, Director & Member-Operating Committee and Executive Council",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q18.pdf
answer,"I'll add the other thing is really you got to look at the whole relationship versus picking apart loan side versus the deposits. But we didn't have the leveraged lease impairment, $5 million you pointed out, that's about 3 basis points of that change too. So, that's the other piece of this.","David J. Turner, Jr.","Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Member-Executive Council and Operating Committee",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q18.pdf
question,"Yeah. It's just kind of hard to triangulate, though, with some of your peers having 30 bps, 40 bps, 30-plus bp yield pickup sequentially, pointing to the higher LIBOR and you guys have been pretty consistent at 10-basis-point per quarter when you have a rate hike. So, everything you said makes sense, but I wonder if there's anything – it has anything to do with how you – is it hedging strategy or the structure of the loan? Because it seems like there's a bit of a disconnect versus what we've seen some of the other banks report.",Saul Martinez,Analyst,UBS Securities LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q18.pdf
answer,"Yeah. So, you've got to look at mix. You have to look at everybody's hedging strategy, but you look at our asset sensitivity, 25% of it is on the short term, 25% of it is in the middle term and 50% is on the long-end. So, that will have a little bit of a dampening impact in terms of rate increases that move up. And so, I think that it's really hard to compare peer-to-peer. There are a lot of puts and takes on it.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer, Director & Member-Operating Committee and Executive Council",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q18.pdf
question,"Yeah. Fair enough. If I could just get in a quick one, the indirect-other consumer obviously growing pretty well with the GreenSky, but where do you think – can you remind us where you think that book can grow to in terms of absolute size over the next year or two?",Saul Martinez,Analyst,UBS Securities LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q18.pdf
answer,"Yeah. So, we do have limits in terms of how much we want our indirect-other to get to. Right now, our indirect- other consumer is about $1.7 billion. We're looking at that number to be in that $2 billion range. So, some growth there, but not an extraordinary growth.","John M.

question,"Hello. Thank you for taking the question. Maybe following up on the earlier discussion on M&A, can you kind of outline both on the non-bank side and the bank side either from a product point of view or geography point of view? Are there areas where if the price was right and the economics were right, you'd be particularly interested from a strategic perspective?",Geoffrey Elliott,Analyst,Autonomous Research,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q18.pdf
answer,"I'm happy to. With respect to non-bank, I think our focus has been on, as I said earlier, adding capabilities, so whether it'd be in capital markets or in wealth management as an example, adding products and capabilities that help us fill gaps to meet customer needs. We've been acquiring loan portfolios, more servicing rights and those things and we'll continue to do. We have capacity within our mortgage servicing operations. We think we do that well and so we will continue to likely add to that portfolio. On the bank side, I think typically our interest is going to be in footprint. We talk about size and I think that that ranges, but our conversations have been in the $3 billion to $15 billion kind of range. We're not interested, as I said earlier, in doing a transaction that would be significantly dilutive to tangible book value and earn-backs are important to us. I hope that gives you a little bit of perspective.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer, Director & Member-Operating Committee and Executive Council",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q18.pdf
question,"Got it. That does. And then, a quick one on CCAR. It looks from the CCAR results like there's some preferred issuance baked into the ask, as I think that was last year as well. Could you discuss a little bit – well, firstly, confirm that's the case and then discuss the circumstances when you'd be expecting to issue preferred?",Geoffrey Elliott,Analyst,Autonomous Research,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q18.pdf
answer,"Yeah. So, Geoffrey, originally, we had a preferred issuance built in, but that was in 2019. We do need to continue to watch changes, regulatory changes, with regards to the SCB in terms of how that might impact our capital ratios in terms of will it have us – have more common and therefore negate the need to have preferred stock over time. There's more to come there, but we want to make sure that also we have an appropriate amount of capital Tier 1 and Common Equity Tier 1. Our focus right now in the short term has been to get our common equity down to our 9.5% target range. And as we do that, we need to make sure we backfill appropriately for Tier 1. And if we don't get relief through the SCB, then we'll have preferred issuance in there right now pegged in 2019.","John M.

question,"Okay.

Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer, Director & Member-Operating Committee and Executive Council",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q18.pdf
answer,"Yeah. Good morning, everyone. We're making good progress on Simplify and Grow initiative. As we said earlier, we've got about 40 initiatives that are underway. We started this about seven months ago and I think we're off to a really good start. Let me give you a couple of examples of projects we have underway. I think that might provide some color and background. First one to focus on would be our consumer lending space. We've got a team working on how do we take all of our consumer lending categories and make them fully 100% digital, meaning a customer can come in, start a digital channel where it's mobile device, iPad or laptop, start there and finish that loan completely digital. We're going to do that for all consumer loan categories. We're well down the road in that process. I would tell you, by the end of 2018, we'll have the majority of that work done. Maybe some things will spill over into 2019, but an example of some of the changes we made, I'll take the mortgage application process. We've re-engineered that process. We've gone through and taken out about half of the data requirements for the application and it's taken the application time down from over 15 minutes to under 5 minutes. The other thing we're seeing is a huge shift in adoption in terms of filling out your application in digital format. In December, only about 20% of our apps were filled out in the digital space. We're now about approaching 60% of our applications filled out in that digital space. The other one I would point out, another initiative is in our commercial lending process. We've gone through and really put a dedicated team focused at how do we re-engineer that process, really with the goal being for us to get a faster answer back to customer. So, from application time to a yes or a no to a customer, we've dropped that by about 70%. And so, the team has done a great job of making banking much easier for our commercial customers. The last one I'd point out would be in our contact center area. We've gone through and used IBM Watson in our contact center really to provide some assistance to our reps, so they can better assist our customers. Couple use cases that we have deployed, the first being for certain call types, Watson will actually take the call, handle the call with the customer and service that call right there with Watson. We've had about 700,000 calls already year- to-date that Watson has handled that call from start to finish and that's equivalent to about 55 contact center reps in that initiative alone. The other thing we've done is we've gone through and really tried to arm our reps to be able to have quick, fast answers back to customers. And we have Watson set up almost in a chat mode. So, a customer – I mean, a rep can actually ask Watson a question when they have a customer on the phone. They've done that 700,000 times year-to-date. And so, a lot of good work there, a lot of good energy. As David mentioned earlier about head count and one of the things that when you think about head count and I'll say corporate real estate, those are two big indicators that you can watch to see us where we're making progress on our Simplify and Grow strategy. We're down about 770 positions through June and that's a direct result of management actions that have been taken with these 40-plus initiatives that are out there. Also Regions Insurance closing on July 2, that's about 644 positions eliminated there. And in the balance of the second half of the year, you'll see Simplify and Grow impact probably another 500 positions in the second half of this year. That's over 1,900 positions. And what I would tell you is that will really show up in 2019 when we get the full run rate. The last point I would make would be on the real estate side. We've got a good opportunity to continue to reduce our space across the bank. We'll be down about 700,000 square feet this year. We expect that trend to continue.",John B. Owen,"Senior Executive Vice President, Head-Enterprise Services and Consumer Banking & Member-Executive Council and Operating Committee",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q18.pdf
answer,"So, Betsy, I'll add to that. So, our operating leverage today is 2.7%. We are reiterating our guidance of 3% to 5% for the year. We get there both by having improvements in revenue whether it comes from rate, balance sheet growth, Simplify and Grow initiative helps revenue and then continuing to watch our cost for the remainder of the year. You'll see the benefit that, as John just mentioned, really ramp up in the third and fourth quarter, such that it gives us confidence that not only are we going to meet our operating leverage target, but we'll also get our efficiency ratio below the 60% level. Betsy L. Graseck Analyst, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC Q Got it. That was really helpful color. It sounds like you were well-prepared for that question. Yeah.","David J.

question,"Yeah. Exactly. One other just a separate topic, but, David, on the capital, I know we talked a little bit about capital and capital return already, just – especially since the Insurance acquisition – or Insurance, sorry, sale is happening this year, is there any opportunity to do a mid-quarter ask or a de minimis as well in terms of a capital return?",Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q18.pdf
answer,"Well, so we had baked into our submission to the extent we generated capital that we were also going to be able to include that. And that is in the numbers that you see. So, that $300 million has already been asked for. So, there's no need to go back. There's always an opportunity to go back on a de minimis. The de minimis is a fairly small number now. And we'll have to see circumstances changes. We did not anticipate that, but it's always an option.","David J. Turner, Jr.","Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Member-Executive Council and Operating Committee",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q18.pdf

question,"I just wanted to follow up on the efficiency ratio looking out longer term, if you're still targeting bringing it down to the mid-50s and over what timeframe do you think you can get there.",Peter J. Winter,Analyst,"Wedbush Securities, Inc.",regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q18.pdf
answer,"Yeah. Peter, that's a good question. So, we've been pretty focused on our 2018 to kind of make sure we meet that. It's the third year of our three-year plan we laid out in Investor Day in November of 2015. Now, we are going to have our Investor Day in February of 2019 where we will have our scorecard. I won't be going through what we're going to do and that we're going to be laying out expectations for the next three years. You've heard me mention before I think our industry is going to have to become more efficient over time and I think we will certainly do that. And I think targeting something in the mid-50s to maybe even better than that over time is on the table. I think you should see us through Simplify and Grow initiatives to get just a little better each quarter, but when can we hit that mid-50s? We haven't really gone out and said that. You're going to have to wait and show up in February to hear it, but I think in the not-too-distant future, we could actually get there.","David J. Turner, Jr.","Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Member-Executive Council and Operating Committee",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q18.pdf
answer,"Yeah. I would just reiterate that. I think we're very focused on continuing to improve the efficiency of our operation and we'd make the point that our Simplify and Grow initiative, we've tried to be clear that it's not a program. It's really about making a cultural shift here at Regions. It's about developing a culture of continuous improvement. We've got to always be looking for how do we make it easier for our customers and bankers to do business, how do we improve our processes, how do we drive efficiency to be more effective and deliver more value for our shareholders? So, we're very committed to doing that.","John M.

question,"That's really helpful. And just a follow-up, if I look last year, the share buyback coming out of CCAR, you frontend loaded that buyback. Should we expect kind of the similar type trend this year?",Peter J. Winter,Analyst,"Wedbush Securities, Inc.",regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q18.pdf
answer,"Well, we haven't laid out our timing, Peter, but we have a pretty tall order to get that done as soon as possible and that's our goal. We're carrying excess capital right now that's really been an anchor from a return standpoint and we would like to get that capital right-sized sooner rather than later. And so, I'll leave it at that.","David J.

question,Hi. Good morning.,Erika Najarian,Analyst,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q18.pdf
answer,"Good morning. Erika Najarian Analyst, Bank of America Merrill Lynch Q Just one follow-up question from me. You mentioned that 93% of your consumer deposits have high-quality checking accounts tied to them. Obviously, the consumer beta stands at 1% on the cumulative basis. I guess I just wanted to make sure I'm understanding the message correctly. A lot of your peers are starting to guide towards more aggressive betas going forward. Is it that a lot of your consumer retail accounts are transactional and don't have that excess cash that potentially could rotate away from Regions into some of these online offerings? Are we reading that correctly?","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer, Director & Member-Operating Committee and Executive Council",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q18.pdf
answer,"Now, that's a big piece of our deposit base and that's why it's been fairly stable. That's why it was – our beta was low last time. That's why we think it will be low this time. And we have the core checking account of our consumer base and that is really, really important, very granular, average deposit of about $3,500 on account. So, that's what makes us unique and that's how we'll win from a beta standpoint.","David J. Turner, Jr.","Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Member-Executive Council and Operating Committee",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q18.pdf
question,Great. Thank you.,Erika Najarian,Analyst,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q18.pdf
answer,Thank you.,"John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer, Director & Member-Operating Committee and Executive Council",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q18.pdf
question,"Thanks. David, I had a similar question as Erika, but just want to look at it from the angle of the non-metro markets. To what extent does that keep working for you as we get further along in the right cycle? Is that still a benefit that you have?",Christopher William Marinac,Analyst,FIG Partners LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q18.pdf
answer,"Yeah, absolutely. We think it's foundational to who we are and non-metro markets, that's a big part of our deposit base. It's not just deposits, but it's the whole relationship that we have with these customers that are very loyal to us. And we dominate in those markets. So, it's important for us to continue to provide good, solid customer service and we will retain those deposits, which we think, again, is foundational and really is the differentiator. We've had this strategic advantage for a long time, but without rates rising some, we couldn't extract the value until now. And so, we think that continues on in the future. Now, the offset to that is our deposit growth relative to some of those smaller markets isn't as robust as some of the major metros, which is why you have seen us make some investments in major metros like Atlanta, where we can capture some of that faster growth, but we don't want to abandon that core customer base in the smaller markets. So, that's really our strategy on both sides.","David J. Turner, Jr.","Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Member-Executive Council and Operating Committee",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q18.pdf
question,"That's very helpful. Is there a way to pinpoint the kind of rate advantage between metro versus non-metro, even in just in the big-picture context?",Christopher William Marinac,Analyst,FIG Partners LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q18.pdf
answer,"We can get back to you on that, Christopher.","David J. Turner, Jr.","Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Member-Executive Council and Operating Committee",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q18.pdf

question,"David, can you share with us – in the securities portfolio, I think you said that about $12 billion to $14 billion reinvest every year. Did I hear that correctly?",Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q18.pdf
answer,"That's total assets, Gerard.","David J. Turner, Jr.","Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Member-Executive Council and Operating Committee",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q18.pdf
question,"Oh, okay.",Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q18.pdf
answer,"Yeah. It's probably $2 billion, $3 billion in the securities book and about $10 billion, $11 billion in the loan book.","David J. Turner, Jr.","Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Member-Executive Council and Operating Committee",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q18.pdf
question,"Okay. In the securities book, what yields are you giving up when it rolls off and what are you reinvesting it in and what is the duration of that portfolio as well?",Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q18.pdf
answer,"Yeah. So, our duration really hasn't changed over time. We're in 4, 4.5 years in terms of duration. What's rolling off is in the 250 range and what's going on is about in the 315 range. So, that was one of the benefits of rates just stay here. That reinvestment of maturities, again both in securities and loans, is a big benefit to us.","David J. Turner, Jr.","Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Member-Executive Council and Operating Committee",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q18.pdf
question,"Very – very true. And then, circling back to deposits, one of your peer banks talked about they're seeing their commercial customers using their cash for capital expenditures, which is one of the reasons they felt their commercial loan growth was a bit modest. Is there any evidence with your corporate and commercial loan book in talking to your customers that they're drawing down on their deposits for capital expenditures and down the road, you might see the loan growth as they used up those excess deposits?",Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q18.pdf
answer,"Gerard, this is John. Yeah, we think that is exactly the case. And we would point to $500 million more or less in deposit declines that we think have been directly related to customers putting that to work. That's sort of a – that's a more specific number than it ought to be more of a round number, I guess, but that – kind of the runoff that we've seen has, I think, largely been, we believe, used by customers to invest in their businesses. And as a result, at some point, we think that will translate into additional loan growth.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer, Director & Member-Operating Committee and Executive Council",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q18.pdf
question,"Right. Okay. Thanks. And then just lastly, David, you mentioned that you're outperforming on the beta. Have you guys figured out why the beta so far this year has just moved so slowly? Is it just the nominal rate of interest rates being so low or is there another factor?",Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q18.pdf
answer,"Well, I think for us, if you look at our retail base betas of 1%, it gets back to the makeup of our deposit base and who our customers are which was really Chris' first question I was trying to answer. If you go to the business side, we've had cumulative beta of about 44%. Those are oftentimes large corporate customers that are looking every time rates go up for their fair share. And I think that we have to be prepared for that just like we are on competitiveness from a loan pricing standpoint. But what differentiates us is our intense focus on relationship banking. Whether it be on the consumer side, the business services side or the wealth side, it's really important for us to maintain that relationship and have all the products and services delivered to our customers. And we think that's what helps keep us – keeps our beta down as well.","David J.

question,"Good afternoon, guys.",Ryan M. Nash,Analyst,Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q19.pdf
answer,"Good morning, Ryan.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q19.pdf
question,"Hey. Good morning, guys. So, it looks like you've seen an inflection in deposit costs, although at 29% you had one of the lowest beta cycle to date. So, you're talking about the NIM approaching 3.40% and then increasing. Can you just talk about how you feel about your ability to bring down deposit costs across retail, wealth and commercial? And then, as you think about the sensitivities you've outlined, given all the changing dynamics on the balance sheet, how do you think about the sensitivity to short- versus long-term rates? And then, I have a follow- up.",Ryan M. Nash,Analyst,Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q19.pdf
answer,"Okay. This is David. So, yeah, I mean we're encouraged by the reaction of our teams on deposit cost. We clearly are competitive, but we're able in the month of June, through our actions we took the month before that to reduce deposit cost couple of basis points. And we've put that in a chart to show you that we expect that to have already peaked. To the extent that we continue to get short-term rates down, that will give us even more ability to reduce deposit costs. We have about 10% of our deposits are indexed – 10% of our interest-bearing deposits are indexed, but we also have another 10% of our interest-bearing deposits that have been exception priced or really money market type deposits that we get to address as rates change. So, we can move pretty quickly as the market changes, which gives us some confidence that we continue to hold our margin at that 3.40% level for the remainder of the year, even if we get the two, roughly three cuts that the forwards imply.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q19.pdf
question,"Got it. And maybe as my follow-up, you talked about the environment being challenging and it might be hard to hit some of your targets. I guess if the rate environment does improve, do you think you could still approach the low end of your efficiency and RoTCE targets? And then, second, do you expect to continue to be able to generate positive operating leverage, even if you don't hit the targets? Thanks.",Ryan M. Nash,Analyst,Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q19.pdf
answer,"Yeah. So, we made a commitment at Investor Day that we would generate positive operating leverage each year of our three-year plan. Clearly, the rate outlook puts some pressure on that, but we still are committed to generating positive operating leverage. If you recall, the last three-year plan that we had, the market didn't behave quite like we thought it was going to either. And we pulled whatever it took to make sure we met the targets, and so we have confidence in that. Clearly, if we have a persistent low rate environment for this whole three-year period, that does put pressure on certain of those metrics. But I would like to point out, we're six months into our three-year plan. There are a lot of things that can happen. And so, we're confident we have a good plan that we have the ability to toggle and do what we need to do to continue to improve our financial performance, and we will do that. That was the commitment that was in our prepared comments, both from John and from me.","David J.

answer,"Morning, John.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q19.pdf
question,"Good morning. On the expense topic still, just I guess longer term you had a expectation for a below 55% efficiency ratio in 2021 or by 2021. Can you just let us know how you're thinking about that level and if it's still attainable despite the rate backdrop just given your hedging, et cetera? Thanks.",John Pancari,Analyst,Evercore ISI,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q19.pdf
answer,"Yeah. So, as I tried to mention to Ryan then, three years is a long time. If you just did the math on this rate persisting for that entire three-year period of time, it would be pretty hard to get to a 55% efficiency ratio because what we don't want to do is cut our expenses so much we damage our franchise. We can get pretty close to that even in that rate environment because of all the hedging that's in place. But could we hit 55%? It'd be – again, this rate environment persisting the entire time would be pretty tough.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q19.pdf
answer,"But I would say, John, I mean we're going to remain focused on effective expense management, while investing in our business. And so, you can expect us to continue to deliver on our commitment to maintain expenses to flat to down slightly, while investing in our business and hopefully growing revenue despite what is a challenging interest rate environment.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q19.pdf
answer,"And let me add something to that, John, because we're talking about the interest rate environment. If we have a low rate environment with slope to the yield curve, that's very helpful. If we have, obviously, a higher rate environment with a slope that's ideal, a low and flat rate environment is where we would have pressure on that 55% margin.","David J.

question,"Right, right. Got it. Okay. And then, my follow-up is around credit. Just wanted to see if we can get a little bit more color on the increase in charge-offs on the commercial front where they came from. And then also your non- performers still saw a moderate increase in the quarter despite the higher charge-offs, so implying that we're seeing a pickup in inflows here. Could you talk about what is driving that? Thanks.",John Pancari,Analyst,Evercore ISI,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q19.pdf
answer,"Sure. It's Barb. Relative to charge-offs that was driven by one loan, it was in the – come out of the healthcare sector, it's something that we have been working on for quite a while and finally came to a resolution. So, we don't see anything systemic in there. Relative to the NPLs, it was three loans that really drove those numbers, of which one has since been paid off. And the other two, at this point we don't expect any loss from them, so again nothing systemic. We're still seeing credit as being stable in our outlook going for the balance of the year. And we're committed to get to the 40 to 50 basis point range again for the balance of the year.",Barbara I.

question,"Hi. There are some puts and takes on the balance sheet and kind of outside of loans you talked about balance from securities, reinvesting them.

I just want to make sure I've got all the puts and takes there.",Matthew Derek O'Connor,Analyst,"Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.",regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q19.pdf
answer,"Yeah. Matt, I would tell you some of those investment transactions were toward the end of the quarter. So, if you look at our average, our average is below what the ending was. So, we're going to feel a little bit of pressure on earning assets from that trade into the third quarter. So, it's really not as much on growing net interest income and margin on earning assets as it is of the mix and being able to react to deposit pricing should we have rate reductions.","David J.

question,"Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And then now just following up on the line of credit discussion right before me, the early stage delinquency numbers also moved up. And did that relate to the healthcare loan or the commercial inflows, one of which paid off, or was that driven by something different?",Matthew Derek O'Connor,Analyst,"Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.",regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q19.pdf
answer,"Yeah. Part of that is seasonal in our 30-day buckets. 90-day buckets were down. 30-day was up marginally. And there was nothing systemic in there at all.

answer,"Yeah. Thank you. Our interest in bank M&A hasn't changed. We remain focused on the execution of our plans. We don't see any material change in the economic analysis of bank M&A. And so, we're going to continue to watch the market. We're going to continue to pay attention to what's occurring, but our position hasn't changed. With respect to non-bank M&A, we continue to look for opportunities to add capabilities to help grow and diversify revenue, to meet customer needs. We recently announced the acquisition of Highland which is a wealth management capability that's complementary to our healthcare business and one that we're excited about. It's a smaller transaction like the others that we have done, but is meaningful. And then, again, it helps us, we think, grow and diversify our revenue and meet the customer needs by adding some capabilities. We have been actively looking at mortgage servicing rights acquisitions. But with the rate environment, those transactions have become more challenging to find, but we'll continue to do that. And within our other businesses, we're again always looking for opportunities to add to our capabilities and we'll remain active there.","John M.

answer,Morning.,"John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q19.pdf
question,Yeah. You guys are putting a little bit more emphasis on the expense side. I was just wondering if you could talk about some of the levers because it certainly doesn't seem like you're going to slow down the investments.,Peter Winter,Analyst,"Wedbush Securities, Inc.",regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q19.pdf
answer,"Yeah. Peter, that last statement is really important because we are continuing to look for ways to make banking easier for our customers looking to make investments in talent and technology, and we have to pay for that. And the way to do that is to continue to focus on our expenses and leverage our Simplify and Grow continuous improvement program that we started a little over a year-and-a-half ago. If we're going to control our expenses, we have to really have an intense focus on our top three categories, salaries and benefits being number one, we're down some 300 positions this quarter. We continue to look to opportunities to streamline operations by leveraging technology and most of that gets handled through attrition. We've looked at occupancy as our next biggest category. As we had in our prepared comments, we had some 400,000 square feet of space that we're exiting. Some of it we have exited. Some of it we just put in held for sale, and we will be getting out of that space to save us on run rate occupancy. Also, furniture, fixtures and equipment, our third category; as we have fewer people, we have smaller space, we can save there as well. That probably through our fourth category would be kind of purchasing vendor spend, if you will. We have a – I do have a procurement that has really put in a lot of rigor in terms of helping us from a demand management standpoint on controlling what we need from a purchasing standpoint, whether it be consulting hours or products or whatever the case may be. And so, in this type of challenging revenue environment and a commitment to positive operating leverage, you just have to pull every string that you can in terms of controlling expenses.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q19.pdf
answer,"And I'd add, Peter, as we've said a few times, we're really pleased with our Simplify and Grow initiative and we're really only beginning to see the benefits of the continuous improvement work that's occurring. And I'd ask John Owen who has led that initiative just to briefly talk about a couple of other things that – opportunities that we see through the use of our digital capabilities to drive improvement. John?","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q19.pdf
answer,"Yeah. Good morning, everybody. We added about 17 new initiatives to our Simplify and Grow list in the second quarter, bringing that number up to about 62 initiatives. We've already completed 13 year to date. We'll complete another 11 initiatives in the second half of 2019. When I think about some of the things we can point to, go back to Investor Day, we talked about launching our digital lending platform in the consumer side of the house. That has really taken traction. We're seeing 38% of our applications today come in through that digital channel. On the eSign, e-close part of this, we were up to about 58% of our direct loans. Closings of eSigns are really good traction on our digital lending capabilities. On the account opening really on the digital front, the thing I'd point you to, we've had a team as part of Simplify and Grow working now for about a year on how do we streamline account opening, how do we make the credit card process a more smooth process and a quicker process. We've revised the application. We've streamlined. And we now are getting about 53% increase in our digital account openings and checking accounts and about a 44% increase in credit card production to that digital channel. So, really good traction there. On the AI front, we continue to look for use cases on how we can roll out AI across the bank. You're all familiar with what we've done in the contact center. We've expanded a couple things in the contact center with AI. One of those is now we launched password resets, which is one of our top calls into the center. We launched that in this month and we're seeing really good traction in having our AI virtual agent handle those password resets. The last thing is we're having good success with AI in our quality assurance functions, where we're actually having the AI virtual agent, quality assurance, the call types, the categories and really go through and make sure that our reps are following the right disclosures and right scripts. That's reduced our expenses in that QA area by about 70%, so good traction with AI as well.",John B. Owen,Chief Operating Officer & Senior Executive Vice President,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q19.pdf
answer,Good. Thank you.,"John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q19.pdf
question,"That's great. And then if I could ask, with the hedging strategy really you're starting to kick in beginning in next year and you gave the outlook for the margin in the first quarter. Should we expect the margin going forward next year to be kind of flat to up?",Peter Winter,Analyst,"Wedbush Securities, Inc.",regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q19.pdf
answer,"Yeah. I think the – to the extent – so we're all assuming that the forwards actually work their way through for next year. As you can see on the chart, I think it was slide 6 where we're trying to show you more and more hedging – more and more of the derivatives actually become effective which helps us stabilize margin. And what we're trying to do through the hedging program is just neutralize the impact of insurance policy on lower rates, which prevents us from having to grow net interest income and margin from coming out of a hole. So, now you can have organic growth in the balance sheet putting on good earning assets that give you the kind of growth that you want to have. So, we're not having to work against, say, a headwind like we think many others might have. And so, we do have the ability to grow depending on what we put on in terms of earning assets in 2020.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q19.pdf
question,Great. Thanks a lot.,Peter Winter,Analyst,"Wedbush Securities, Inc.",regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q19.pdf

answer,"Morning, Ken.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q19.pdf
question,"Thanks. Good morning, guys. Good morning, guys. Thank you. Just a follow-up on that last question, so your scenario that you put out on page 5 which is really helpful bakes in the three potential cuts that are in the forward curve, and this might be just more of a semantic one. But I'm just wondering if the Fed only gives us one, how does that cadence change potentially in terms of the decline before the hedges come on? Like is it just that you end up in the same place, but from a slightly different way of getting there? Just trying to understand how the cadence might change if we don't fully get there, the three cuts in the curve.",Ken Usdin,Analyst,Jefferies LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q19.pdf
answer,"Yeah. So, Ken, a couple things to think about our sensitivity. We really have two things working. First is, to your point, the short end of the curve. So, the short end of the curve is where our derivatives are tied to, generally speaking, one-month LIBOR. We have receive fixed. So, cuts in the short term with the protection on the receive fixed derivatives and our ability to reduce deposit cost in that 35% deposit beta that we are talking about gives us the confidence that we have at 2020. So, even if you have one, two, three cuts in the short end, we have protection under any of those scenarios. Then the second part is what happens to the long end of the curve. And so, if we have slope to the curve, even in a lower rate environment if we have slope, we're protected as well because the reinvestment is coming off the investment portfolio and the like really are tied to the long end. What we don't want is to have a lower and flatter yield curve which is horrible for our industry as you know. So, we're not as concerned about whether it's one, two or three because we'll react appropriately as long as we can get the long end to, at least, stay where it is and maybe even increase a bit.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q19.pdf
question,"Got it. So, regardless of the pacing then, you feel pretty good that that 1Q 2020 low-to-mid 3.20s (sic) [3.40s] (00:39:07) can happen in most any circumstance except for a meaningfully flatter curve environment?",Ken Usdin,Analyst,Jefferies LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q19.pdf
answer,"That's exactly right. And our protection – we've started putting this on over a year-and-a-half ago with the expectation that we were going to be in this environment, we just thought it would be beginning in 2020 which is why we did forward starting. We thought there were going to be rate increases through 2019 and we want to stay asset sensitive, so we've been caught a little bit exposed in the latter part of 2019 as have every peer of ours. But we're feeling pretty good about what can take place in 2020. And going forward, we have duration on those swaps and floors of five years beginning in 2020. So, we have really good protection then.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q19.pdf
question,"Okay, got it. And then last just a cleanup on the – those forward starting swaps that – you've got the fixed rate strike on there. I mean, are they meaningfully different ones? The average is obviously 2.48% for the swaps and 2.08% for the floors on page 6. But as you put them on, are they all around kind of a general average there or are there – it depends upon which one they could be very much in or out of the money across the book?",Ken Usdin,Analyst,Jefferies LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q19.pdf
answer,"Yeah, the averaging that we've given you, so we went to disclose a lot more this time to give you the ability to do your models and we think the averaging is going to be representative enough. There'll be 25 points here or there, but nothing is really going to skew that from using the averages.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q19.pdf

question,Hi. Good morning.,Erika Najarian,Analyst,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q19.pdf
answer,Good morning.,"John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q19.pdf
question,"Good morning. I just wanted to clarify the response to Ryan's earlier question, as we think about the 35% deposit beta, given that deposit costs already peaked in May, is that for the initial 25 basis points? And as we think about 2020, what do you think – and if the forward curve is right in that we'll get three cuts and then maybe not anymore, what could the ultimate sort of reverse deposit beta be on the 75 basis points of cut?",Erika Najarian,Analyst,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q19.pdf
answer,"Yeah. I think we're going to start at 35%. I think, over time – we're at 29% cumulative going up. So, if you're starting at 35%, you would expect that to drift down a bit as time goes through. I think that's what you're asking.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q19.pdf
question,"Just to clarify, the initial impact is immediate in terms of the 35%, especially on the 20% of your interest-bearing deposits that you are identifying as either quite expensive or indexed, and then the repricing would taper off in terms of percentage of cuts rather than accelerate. I guess I'm...",Erika Najarian,Analyst,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q19.pdf
answer,"You're exactly right. So, it starts at 35% and then at the end of day, you're going to drift from that 35% down into the higher 20s as at. And the driver of that is the 10% indexing at the exception pricing and then just looking at the market of all of our deposits as we compare to our peers. And we get the benefit of our floors and we get the benefit of our receive fixed swaps.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q19.pdf
question,"Got it. And, John, just wanted to clarify, I hear you loud and clear that 55% and below on efficiency is difficult in this rate environment. You did say something earlier as a reply to a question that flat to down slightly on expenses is still a commitment. And is that what we should think about over this three-year period, regardless of the rate environment?",Erika Najarian,Analyst,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q19.pdf
answer,"Yes. So, this is David. So, the flat to slightly down was an answer to 2019 change in our guidance there. I think your question is, well, then, what does it mean for the next three years if we're in this challenging revenue environment? We clearly – we have 2%, 2.5% inflation baked into our expense base every year. And so, we have to continue to see cuts. If we want to keep expenses relatively stable, we have to find ways to cut that 2.5%. And then if we want to make investments on top of that, we got to find even more. Our commitment is that we would generate positive operating leverage under any of those environments each of those three years. Clearly, a lower rate environment, a flatter yield curve makes that very tough. But that's what we seek to do and we're going to do whatever it takes to meet the expectations that we've laid out. The commitment was 55% three years from now. We're only six months there, so we're not giving up on 55% by any stretch.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q19.pdf

question,"Hey. Good morning, everybody.",Saul Martinez,Analyst,UBS Securities LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q19.pdf
answer,Morning.,"John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q19.pdf
answer,"Hi, Saul.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q19.pdf
question,"So, I guess I'm still a little bit confused on the 35% deposit data and the glide path thereafter for future cuts. So, are you saying that on the first 25 basis point cut you'll see a decline in your interest-bearing deposit cost of – or 35% beta on the decline on your interest-bearing deposit costs? And over what time period does that occur? Is that sort of an immediate decline or is that something that drags on over a couple quarters [ph] as repricing (00:45:01) filters in? Because it seems like the commentary from some other banks has been that there is going to be a lag in terms of deposit betas and that they're going to accelerate, not decelerate as further rate cuts happen.",Saul Martinez,Analyst,UBS Securities LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q19.pdf
answer,"Yeah. So, we felt like ours were going to happen a little quicker because of the indexing that we have on 10% of our $60 billion of interest-bearing deposits, another 10% exception price that we can move quickly, too. So, we think that can be pretty high early on and we think that that could be maintained perhaps for a couple of quarters. At some point, though, that has to taper off. We're only up to 29%. So, if you start at 35%, at some point it has to taper off as you get to an absolute floor in terms of deposit costs. So, does that help?","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q19.pdf
question,"Yeah, I think so. So, the 35% then you're saying is pretty immediate [ph] at this point (00:46:01).",Saul Martinez,Analyst,UBS Securities LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q19.pdf
answer,That's correct.,"David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q19.pdf
question,"Okay. And I guess just more of a conceptual question then on NII and how to think about net interest income growth in 2020 and 2021 and I'm certainly not asking for guidance. I know it's too early for that. But to the extent you have stabilized your rate sensitivity, you've neutralized it to a large degree. When we think about NII growth beyond this year, should we be thinking net interest income grows more in line with loan growth, average earning balance growth and mix shift and that occurs not necessarily independently of rates, but that being a much bigger driver of net interest income growth, regardless of what the rate environment does?",Saul Martinez,Analyst,UBS Securities LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q19.pdf
answer,"Well, that's exactly what we're trying to communicate that our hedging program is giving us the opportunity to not have to climb out of a hole to grow NII margin, rather neutralizes that. It was insurance protection of the low rate environment, not to give us a tailwind, but to keep us from having this massive headwind and, therefore, we could participate in to growing NII and margin as we continue to grow earning assets watching our deposit cost. Our deposit franchise is still our number one competitive advantage, and we think that's going to help us continue to grow NII with appropriate balance sheet growth.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q19.pdf
question,"Okay. No, that's helpful. I could sneak one quick final one in. I don't know if I missed it, but the outlook for indirect auto and indirect other consumer now that you've exited GreenSky – or not exited – not renewed the commitment there, how do we think about – can you remind us what your expectations are for balances there? And how much [ph] lines (00:48:01) and what the other consumer [ph] lines (00:48:03) balance should do?",Saul Martinez,Analyst,UBS Securities LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q19.pdf
answer,"And so if you look at in our supplemental on page 21, you'll see our indirect vehicle declined this past quarter some $350 million. So, we're kind of on that kind of run rate.

Is this the environment where you invest in that or perhaps a few new markets come into the Regions footprint because of external opportunities?,Christopher William Marinac,Analyst,Janney Montgomery Scott LLC.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q19.pdf
answer,"Yeah. I mean, we're – all of our business leaders, well, commercial, corporate, real estate are actively recruiting all the time, our consumer business similarly. One of their task is to always know who the best bankers are in their markets and in contiguous markets, who the best bankers are in their specialized businesses. And so, we're always actively recruiting. I think we've had good success recruiting already this year across particularly our priority markets where we are investing, St. Louis, Atlanta, Houston and Orlando. And we'll continue to do that.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q19.pdf

answer,Good morning.,"John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q19.pdf
question,Good morning. I was hoping you can give us a little more color on the 9.5% CET1 ratio target for the third quarter. It would seem that would imply a pretty aggressive buyback this quarter and then maybe a tail-off through the rest of the CCAR cycle. And maybe just help us out with the cadence of the buyback in the near term and then through the cycle.,Kevin J. Barker,Analyst,Piper Jaffray & Co.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q19.pdf
answer,"Yeah, Kevin, so you're exactly right. We've put into our prepared comments, we were going to get to our 9.5% in the third quarter, so we have loan growth that uses up some of that in dividends and then buying back to get us to that 9.5%. It won't be exactly that every single quarter. But we're going to do what we can to keep it at that level because that's the level of capital we think we need to run the company based on our risk profile. That does imply a quicker buyback or more of a buyback here in the short term. It will moderate after that. And we will use the repurchase ability, so we have authorization for our board up to $1.37 billion of stock buyback. And how we think about capital allocation is, first and foremost we'll pay a dividend of 35% to 45% of our earnings. Then we're going to use some for organic loan growth, and then we'll use the rest, we'll buy stock back to keep us at that 9.5%. Should loans grow faster, buybacks will be smaller and vice versa. If loans don't grow, buybacks will increase, so that we can keep the capital optimized in the company.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q19.pdf
question,"Okay. So, given the authorization that you have for this cycle, it would seem to imply that we keep the loan growth relatively low-single digits or somewhere very close to that or maybe even closer to stable in the near term. Is there anything you're doing within the balance sheet in order to decrease risk-weighted assets or some other way in order to keep the ratio at 9.5% given the buyback authorization you have in place?",Kevin J. Barker,Analyst,Piper Jaffray & Co.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q19.pdf
answer,"No. Our teams are out there growing loans when it makes sense from a risk-adjusted return standpoint. We grew the first quarter a little quicker than we had expected. We slowed that down a bit this quarter. We still have the low- to mid-single digit growth expectation for the year. Again, any given quarter you can see a pace change. The third quarter for us over the last couple years has not been as stronger for growth even though our pipelines look pretty good. The fourth quarter, on the other hand, it's actually been pretty strong. So, we're sticking to that commitment on the loan growth. And my point is that we use 9.5% and we toggle between loan growth and share buyback. We're not trying to manufacture one or the other. We want all the good – we would much rather use our capital to grow organically than to buy our stock back. But we also want to have appropriate risk-adjusted, client relationship type returns on the loan side. And if we don't get those and we can't use our capital to grow appropriately, we will buy our stock back if that makes sense.","David J.

question,"Question, can you guys share with us – we've seen a lot of commentary about the strength of the consumer business and we all know how low the unemployment rate is in this country and wage growth seems to be accelerating. But there seems to be some crosscurrents in the business side of our economy with what's going on with the trade negotiations, et cetera. So, can you give us some insights of what your business customers are sharing with you about their business? And could you tie that into the forward curve of three 25 basis point rate cuts in 2019? It just seems like the forward curve is being a little aggressive on those rate cuts. But I'm just curious to see what you guys think.",Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_2Q19.pdf
answer,"Well, to answer the second half of your question, no, we cannot tie it into the forward curve. I would tell you that our business customers are still cautiously optimistic. Clearly, over the last 90 days or so, I sense more caution on the part of our business owners, but they're still optimistic. Their 2018 results were very good. Most of them are having really good 2019s. As we look at our credit quality across a variety of industry sectors, I really don't see any significant issues other than within the restaurant subsector, we've called out before fast casual, don't appear to be any other stresses of any consequence that we see. Customers have good pipelines. And so, as I think I've said in my prepared remarks, the primary constraint we see on the economy is the availability of skilled labor, and that's the thing that tends to constrain businesses from investing, not the interest rate environment. And so, I really can't tie our view of the economy through our customers' eyes to the forward rate curve.","John M.

answer,"Sure, Gerard. Our teams have been working really hard to run parallel this year. We're feeling good about being prepared for the adoption, obviously, January 2020. We're looking to put something in our 10-Q that would give some indication as to where we might be here shortly on day one. As we've mentioned before, consumer portfolios get hit really hard relative to commercial portfolios. And so, we have about 40% of our consumer loans versus business services loans, so mortgages, HELOCs, credit cards, those unsecured credit, those get hit pretty hard in the CECL adoption, not as much on the commercial side. But just stay tuned here shortly on our 10-Q filing.","David J.

I hope you can tell we think we had a solid quarter despite the volatility in the market. We're focused on things that we can control, client selectivity, sound underwriting, credit servicing, effective expense management, resource allocation and risk-adjusted returns. We have a good plan, we think, to neutralize our interest rate sensitivity. And we believe we're well positioned to continue to execute on our plans, and we stay focused on that.

question,"Just on the expense side, I want to talk a little bit more about the efficiency ratio. I know you're currently in the 58% range, and you're expecting still below 60% for the full year of 2018. When you look at 2019, just given your expense efforts, but also some of the momentum you have on the top line, where do you think that can go? And then longer term, do you think mid-50s is still an appropriate goal beyond that? Thanks.",John Pancari,Analyst,Evercore Group LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q18.pdf
answer,"Hey, John. This is David. Yeah. So we had a nice improvement in our efficiency ratio in the quarter. We continue to expect our efficiency ratio will improve throughout the year and into 2019. We had mentioned that we thought getting into the mid-50s was a reasonable goal for us over time, helped in part by our efficiency efforts, continuous improvement, and lift in revenue from rates and the efforts we have to grow revenue through our investment. So, we still believe mid-50s at this point is a good target. Over time, maybe we get below that but we're going to update all of that for you in February, specifically.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q18.pdf
question,"Okay. All right, thanks. And then separately on the loan growth side, want to get a little bit more thoughts, a little bit more color on where you're seeing the strongest demand and – because we are hearing that a good number of the banks flagged that pay-downs were still relatively elevated and they're impacting their growth outlooks, while others are also flagging the competitive backdrop and lowering their guidance given the competitive dynamics. It doesn't seem that you're seeing that in a profound way. And so wanted to get some of the color you have around those factors. Thanks.",John Pancari,Analyst,Evercore Group LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q18.pdf
answer,"Yeah. John, this is John. I would say, we continue to remain optimistic about our ability to deliver on our commitment to low-single digit loan growth on an adjusted basis. Loan growth was pretty broad based particularly within the wholesale business this quarter. Saw about, if you adjust for the runoff in dealer indirect, about 1% growth in consumer and almost 2% in the wholesale book. We're not facing the headwinds that we had been facing that were the result primarily of our own derisking activities. So, we predicted that we would likely hit a bottom in investor real estate sometime in the second quarter. We did. And we began to see a little pickup in activity there. And so grew a little in the second quarter. And that growth continued into third quarter. Similarly, within our commercial banking activities and corporate banking, the growth has been broad-based across our specialized industries groups, our diversified industries teams, manufacturing, distribution, and across our geographies. I would tell you it is very competitive. Despite the fact that we grew, we passed on about half as much business as we actually produced. And the reason we passed was primarily because of pricing or some other structural element. We didn't experience the pay-downs in the third quarter that others have talked about, but we very much did in the first and second quarter of this year. And you might remember in the third and fourth quarter of 2017. So I'd say it is very competitive. Competition comes from a variety of sources. But we have really solid pipelines and feel good about our ability to deliver on low-single digit adjusted loan growth for the year.","John M. Turner, Jr.",President & Chief Executive Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q18.pdf
question,"Okay. And one more thing, could that low-single digits move up to the mid-single as you think about 2019?",John Pancari,Analyst,Evercore Group LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q18.pdf
answer,"We're still committed to low-single digit loan growth, John. And we think it's important to be very disciplined, to be very prudent about what we booked, focus on client selectivity and risk adjusted returns. We don't need a lot of loan growth to achieve our stated objectives. And so we're going to be careful and thoughtful about what we book. And so our targets are still low-single digit at this point.","John M.

question,"You guys used a lot of your 2018 CCAR approval of buybacks this quarter, but your capital levels are still high. And obviously, the market is selling off overall here including your stock. And just wondering about thoughts in terms of going back, asking for more? And how aggressive you could be on that front?",Matthew O'Connor,Analyst,"Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.",regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q18.pdf
answer,"Yeah, Matt. So we have our targeted capital range that we've espoused before and Common Equity Tier 1 in that 9.5%. We've been working towards that. And as you know, when you file a CCAR plan that we did, didn't receive an objection. It had timing built into that as to when we would buy those shares back as well as have our dividend increase. So in order to change that, we would have to have a resubmission. We think we're on a good glide path right now, given where we are. We made a lot of progress this quarter. As you laid out, our repurchase program will be completed in the fourth quarter. And we can be in the market executing on our next quarter plan after earning – our accelerated share repurchase program I was referring to.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q18.pdf
question,"Okay. When you say your repurchase program completed in 4Q, you're talking about the ASR or your...",Matthew O'Connor,Analyst,"Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.",regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q18.pdf
answer,"Yeah. Yeah. I want to clarify. So the component part of the program, there's a piece of it that's an accelerated share repurchase program. Will be completed in the fourth quarter, and we have other repurchases that are baked in to our CCAR submission after that.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q18.pdf
question,"Okay. And then just the thoughts on the 9.5% CET1 target, like I feel like kind of was set maybe a couple years ago. And it seems like some of your peers have been guiding to hopefully getting into the, call it, 8% to 9% range.",Matthew O'Connor,Analyst,"Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.",regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q18.pdf
answer,"Yeah. Well, I think our peers are really all over the board. For us, it's incumbent upon us to keep the amount of capital we think we need to run our business. And we will continue to update that each year and challenge ourselves. But we also have to be cognizant of where we are. We're nine years into an expansion. Next May will be 10 years. And we think given our risk profile, where we are, and considering all other things, a 9.5% common equity Tier 1 is proper for us at this time. That being said, we'll be looking at that as we wrap up this year and into the first quarter. And we'll make any adjustments we deem appropriate at that time.","John M. Turner, Jr.",President & Chief Executive Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q18.pdf
question,Okay. Thank you.,Matthew O'Connor,Analyst,"Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.",regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q18.pdf
question,"Yes, good morning. Thank you. My first question is, thank you for reminding us about your deposit base. And as we think about further rate hikes from here, how should we think about the stickiness of your interest-free deposit balances? And I'm wondering if you could help us get a sense of the $35 billion in average interest-free deposit balance, how much of that would you call operational or part of checking accounts that are less vulnerable to mix shift?",Erika Najarian,Analyst,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q18.pdf
answer,"Yeah, Erika, maybe I'll start. This is John. I would say to the question of how – what percentage of our deposit balances we think are operational; 67% of all of our deposits are consumer deposits. We think approximately 93% of all of our consumer households maintain some sort of operating account balance with us, obviously on the wholesale side, our corporate bank, all of those deposits that sit in demand deposits, we think of as being operational. So I would believe that the vast majority of our demand deposits are in fact operational in nature. When you look at our consumer book, one of the things that gives us a lot of confidence about our deposit gathering franchise and the strength of our customer base is that over the last year, we've actually grown consumer demand by over 5%, we've grown consumer savings by about 7.3%, and grown NOW deposits by over 1%. So despite the fact that we've been aggressively managing our interest costs, the core of our business which is consumer operating deposits has continued to grow as have checking accounts through the last 12 months.","John M. Turner, Jr.",President & Chief Executive Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q18.pdf
answer,"Erika, I'll add, the noninterest-bearing from a corporate standpoint as we mentioned in the prepared comments, we did see companies utilize their excess liquidity to pay down debt to make fixed capital investments and in some cases seek higher yields than we were willing to pay. And so, we're not losing the customer. They're just choosing to seek the highest return as you would expect all treasurers to do. So, we think we have the ability to really gather deposits. We're looking at loan growth. We want to pare that off, and our commitment is to grow our deposit base, our core deposit base commensurate with our loans over time. You may have a mismatch in a given quarter, but we feel good about where we are in terms of deposit growth looking forward.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q18.pdf
question,"Got it. And just as a follow-up to John's line of questioning. John, I was interested in, when you answered the question about the amount of business that you passed on over during the quarter, and I'm wondering if you could give us a sense, this has been much talked about this quarter, on the level of non-bank competition that you're experiencing. And perhaps, David, if you could give us a sense of any residual exposure on balance sheet to leverage lending or sponsor-backed term facilities?",Erika Najarian,Analyst,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q18.pdf
answer,"Yeah. So, we're seeing competition from non-banks in the real estate mortgage space, so commercial real estate mortgage space from life insurance companies, and commercial banking activities largely around M&A, sponsor- based transactions from business development corporations, private equity-backed funds. And that is having some impact on our business. But as I said to John, the impact was more significant in the first part of the year, particularly in quarter one in parts of quarter two, particularly with respect to the commercial mortgage business. On an ongoing basis, we continue to see private equity-backed funds take more risk in the leverage space than we're willing to take. And as a consequence, we would think that – or suggest that our exposure to leverage lending and to sponsor- backed transactions is very reasonable at about 20% of our leverage exposure down from over 35% about a year ago. So we've continued to reduce our exposure to sponsor-based leverage loans, and in part that's a function of risk selection and I think in part a reflection of just their activity in the marketplace.","John M. Turner, Jr.",President & Chief Executive Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q18.pdf
question,Got it. Thank you.,Erika Najarian,Analyst,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q18.pdf
question,Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. The other consumer indirect bucket continues to be a helpful driver of growth. Can you maybe start just remind us what's in that and what's been driving the growth there?,Geoffrey Elliott,Analyst,Autonomous Research LLP,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q18.pdf
answer,"Sure. So we have indirect coming from a couple of different places. We have indirect auto. And then we have indirect other which is our point-of-sale initiative that we have with several entities. We continue to experience good growth there and good economics on that portfolio. We continue to challenge ourselves on all of our portfolios. The profitability on indirect auto has been challenged. We're a prime, super prime book and all the losses are improved. The economics there have been challenging and we're continuing to look at that. Yields are growing a bit for us there. So those are really the two kind of point-of-sale and indirect auto are the two big categories Geoff.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q18.pdf
answer,"Yeah. I would just add, we got into that business to – because we've began to see consumer preferences develop and evolve. We wanted to learn largely what was going on in that space. We've established some internal concentration limits to manage our exposure to effectively consumer indirect unsecured lending. I think it's to-date been good for us. As David suggested, the credit quality has been good, returns have been good, and we've learned some things through observation, and grown the balance sheet a little bit.","John M. Turner, Jr.",President & Chief Executive Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q18.pdf
question,"Thanks. It looks like it's been a pretty important driver of the NII growth. On those concentration limit, how much are you willing to see the portfolio grow?",Geoffrey Elliott,Analyst,Autonomous Research LLP,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q18.pdf
answer,"I don't recall that we have necessarily been public about limits we've established, but we don't expect the portfolio to grow a whole lot more than its current size.","John M. Turner, Jr.",President & Chief Executive Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q18.pdf
question,Great. Thanks very much.,Geoffrey Elliott,Analyst,Autonomous Research LLP,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q18.pdf
question,"Thanks, good morning, guys. First question, just to follow-up on the liability side. David, you said you issued that debt this quarter and you had some ins and outs about deposits that led to a little bit more on the FHLBs which might happen quarter-to-quarter. But I'm just wondering in terms of the structure of the liability side and the capital stack, where are you in terms of the efficiency of the right side of the balance sheet in terms of that mix of long- term debt, how much more you would be issuing naturally over time and whether preferreds become a more likelihood as that capital ratio grows into itself? Thanks.",Ken Usdin,Analyst,Jefferies LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q18.pdf
answer,"Yes, Ken. So, we did that we're opportunistic with regards to our $1.5 billion that we raised recently, some in the holding company and some in the bank to take advantage of FDIC cost. As we look out at our plan for the holding company, we'll have another debt issuance in the holding company probably in the first quarter and that number will be in the $500 million range. From a preferred standpoint, there are a lot of moving targets in terms of preferred. We need to see what happens from a capital standpoint. We have a lot going on with the regulators and we need to see what happens with the buffer in terms of whether or not we need to issue and how much and when. So you need to stay tuned a little bit on the preferred offering, which may or may not occur in the second half of the year if it occurs.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q18.pdf
question,"Understood. Okay. And then my follow-up is just on coming back to the left side of the balance sheet and the mix of earning assets, you've kept the investment portfolio up pretty stable here for a bit now, now that the loans have started to churn up. Can you just talk about what you're doing in the investment portfolio, what your kind of front book, back book looks like, and are you comfortable with the size of it at this point?",Ken Usdin,Analyst,Jefferies LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q18.pdf
answer,"Well, let me talk more about the total left side of the balance sheets. So our securities book, we feel good about where that is. Obviously, we want to comply with LCR to the extent some of that gets changed regulatorily. Maybe we can put certain of those investment securities in a little healthier return than some of the securities we have today, Ginnie Mae securities, as an example. But in terms of front book, back book, we have about $14 billion of assets that are repricing over the next 12 months, that repricing of securities and loans and that's a pick-up of the 75 basis points to 100 basis points even if rates don't move. If rates stay right where they are now right now, and that's a pretty good tailwind to us from an NII growth and resulting margin. And it's why we've been able to give you the confidence that we could hit our NII growth goals for this year and of course we'll update those for next year later on. But, that's important to note.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q18.pdf
question,"All right. Thanks for that, David.",Ken Usdin,Analyst,Jefferies LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q18.pdf
question,"Hi. Good morning, everybody. Just on credit quality, obviously 40 basis points is still very – oh you did see a bit of an uptick, but still within sort of the guidance range. But can you give us any color on the uptick and any areas of your portfolio you just feel may have more risk than others? Just a general view on where you think credit quality is heading?",Saul Martinez,Analyst,UBS Securities LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q18.pdf
answer,"Yeah. So it's Barb Godin. Relative to the uptick, it was related really to two credits. Nothing systemic in the portfolio that we see, but two credits drove that uptick. And for the rest of the portfolio, it was well-behaved, remained in good condition, moving in the right direction. And as we think about the future in terms of fourth quarter as well, we don't see anything major on the horizon. And again, feel good about our guidance of 35 basis points to 50 basis points. And as you mentioned, 40 basis points is still right there in the middle of our guidance.",Barbara I. Godin,Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q18.pdf
answer,"Yeah. And I would just add, when you look at our overall credit metrics, we continue to see improvement in the level of classified assets, the level of non-performing loans. There's a little uptick in criticized loans this quarter that, to Barb's point, does not reflect anything systemic at all. And all the results reflect the outcome of the recent SNC exam.","John M. Turner, Jr.",President & Chief Executive Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q18.pdf
question,"Okay. Got it. If I could just sort of stay on the theme of credit quality. I know you guys have been critical of certain aspects of CECL. But where are you? Can you just give a sense where you are in terms of your preparation? When do you think – assuming there are no fundamental changes to how CECL works, when do you think you'll have a rough estimate of what the financial impact could be?",Saul Martinez,Analyst,UBS Securities LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q18.pdf
answer,"Yeah. Saul, this is David. So we've been – we've spent an awful lot of time and effort on our modeling and leveraging some of the CCAR models and building some new ones. We're in pretty good shape. We're leveraging third parties to make sure we do this right. And we'll be running parallel. We'll start that in 2019. We'll adjust and learn so that we're prepared for January 2020. As you know, there are discussions on CECL and whether or not there may or may not be modifications to the standard, whether or not there may be a delay or not, we'll just have to see. But it's incumbent upon us to be prepared either way. And as far as when we'll be prepared to give that guidance, we really – before we do that, we want to make sure our models are reflective of our best numbers we can come up with. So it'll be into 2019, probably no earlier than the middle of the year. And we'll just have to see how things develop before we can give you that kind of guidance.","David J.

answer,Morning.,"John M. Turner, Jr.",President & Chief Executive Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q18.pdf
question,"Could we talk a little bit on the expense side? I know in the prepared remarks you highlighted the operating leverage and the outlook, but maybe you could give us a sense of the drivers? And if this is going to be taking place in the near-term due to Simplify and Grow? Or is this something that is a little bit longer tailed with regard to acceleration operating leverage?",Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q18.pdf
answer,"Yeah, Betsy. So there are several things working on operating leverage and efficiency, the revenue side and the expense side. Let me start with revenue. We continue to make investments to grow revenue. Those investments are in people and in technology, making investments in higher growth markets through new branches. And we need to pay for those investments. And so we've been leveraging our continuous improvement process, that we started out with Simplify and Grow. It's going to continue. This is something we want to culturally embed is, how do we get better each and every day through process improvement and leveraging technology? A big part of the expense side has been savings in the S&B line item that you saw this past quarter, which we told you about beginning of the year that you would see the benefits of that in the third quarter. You'd see it again in the fourth quarter. We're substantially through with the larger numbers of head count reductions. You'll see some. But not to the degree that you saw thus far through the nine months of September. And then from there, we have to continue to become more efficient. And it gets back to John's earlier comment on the efficiency ratio, where you think you can go. I just think our industry will continue to become more efficient in leveraging all the new technologies that are out there to get an efficiency ratio, which we think we could target in the mid-50s. We'll see if we can get better than that over time. But that, with a healthy revenue growth and making investments to grow our business are really important to us.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q18.pdf
question,"And then just on the NIM outlook, I know we talked through some of the drivers including securities book. Can you give us a sense as to how sticky you think that uplift that you're looking for in 4Q can persist going forward?",Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q18.pdf
answer,"Well, our margin of 3.50% is better than most of our peers. And so it gets harder as you have a – as you continue to outperform it gets harder to keep outperforming. That being said, we are leveraging what we see as our competitive deposit base, continue to make investments to grow earning assets in particular the loan portfolio as you saw this quarter. So, leveraging off that and the future growth that we see should help us. And obviously, we think December has a pretty high probability of a rate increase in that. And so if LIBOR starts moving 30 days prior to December rate increase and you'll see that benefit even more. Our beta has outperformed and we do expect our beta to get higher, to continue to increase, the pace of which we'll see what happens for the year, we're only cycled to-date about 15%. So, we think that continues to increase. That is baked into our guidance already that we've given you, and we think that continues to help propel us to continuing to grow NII in the fourth quarter and into 2019.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q18.pdf
question,"Okay. And LIBOR-OIS has actually widened a little bit recently. So maybe that's a tailwind into 4Q, or are you already had that baked into your 4Q outlook?",Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q18.pdf

answer,"Good morning, Gerard.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q18.pdf
question,"Can you guys share with us, when we go back and look at your numbers as well as your peers for the last 20 years on non-interest-bearing deposits to total deposits, the industry and yourself included have seen a significant increase in that percentage. In fact, with you guys and post the merger, of course, it looks like it was running around 19%, 20% right around that time in 2007, 2008. Now, it's obviously in the mid-30s. I think it was 38% this quarter. Is there something structurally different with the customers that they keep – that you're able to garner much more of your deposits in noninterest-bearing?",Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q18.pdf
answer,"So Gerard, we have really focused on continuing to grow customer accounts, demand deposit, checking accounts. We've been very good at that and we've grown checking accounts this year about 1.5%. And so we think that that will continue. We expect that to continue, our noninterest bearing demand deposits have also grown over time. We have seen that shrink as have all of our peers this past quarter. We performed a little better than most. And again, that's because we see large companies putting that noninterest-bearing to work either to pay down debt, make fixed capital investments or reinvest in some higher earning securities. We do think that the noninterest-bearing will be higher than history. We think as companies have gone through the liquidity scare that we had in 2008 that people are thinking differently about their liquidity. We think – we'll see if we're right, but we think people will hold on to more of that liquidity and leverage up versus using it all and then leveraging. At least that's our assumption. We'll see how that plays out, but I think it's going back to that liquidity scare in 2008, it's a little bit of a change in terms of how people think about it.","David J.

answer,"Yeah. I'd agree with that, Gerard. I'd also offer – I mentioned 67% of our deposits are consumer deposits and 93% of our consumer households have a primary operating – what we would consider a quality primary operating account with us. The average balances in our deposit accounts are more granular we think than some of our peers, reflects the markets that we're in reflects the type customers that we're banking and we think that that's a competitive advantage. It in fact does result in our maintaining more demand deposits let's say in the consumer space in some regard than we did before and it is a real strength of our franchise.","John M. Turner, Jr.",President & Chief Executive Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q18.pdf
question,"Very good. And then on the other side of the balance sheet, you guys have been very frank and candid about what happened to the investor real estate portfolio post the financial crisis and the recession. And you've been clear about winding it down to a level that you're comfortable with, which seems, as you pointed out, the inflection point might be this quarter. So as we move forward, what type of projects are you guys looking at on the investor real estate whether it's the construction projects or the investor real estate mortgage area? And I think, John, you said you didn't really give any guidance on how big you'd allow different portfolios to grow to as a percentage of total portfolio. But in this one, I don't know if you'd be willing to disclose how big you would allow this one to grow to again as a percentage of the total portfolio.",Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q18.pdf
answer,"Yeah. Today, it's in the 7-plus-percent sort of range as a percentage of total. And I think we'd expect it to stay there to grow potentially up modestly as a percentage of total. You might remember that now going back almost three years, we committed to trying to change the mix of business within investor real estate. In 2014, 85% of our production was construction, primarily of multi-family. And we began to work that level of production down. It had a significant impact on balances as you see and so our balances have significantly declined. We did reach a point in the second quarter when we began to, I think it was in part because of seasoning began to have the opportunity to win a few more commercial mortgage opportunities. And those are typically going to be financing seasoned properties with stabilized cash flows, largely on multi-family office projects. We have some retail exposure, but most of what we're doing is multi-family office and some industrial. And with that comes full relationship. So we pick up deposit balances, we pick up opportunities to generate fee income through our capital markets, secondary market offerings, placement products. And so, we think it's a business we want to grow sort of with the economy maybe plus a little as it provides a lot of ancillary opportunities. But again, it won't grow to be too much larger percentage of the total than it is today.","John M.

question,Great. Thank you.,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q18.pdf
question,"Good morning. I just wanted to ask another question on expenses. You had a nice drop in expenses in the third quarter. Do you think they could drop a little bit more in the fourth quarter given the full quarter benefit of the head count reduction? And then looking at 2019, would you expect expenses to be kind of flat maybe even down a little just given a full year benefit of the lower head count?",Peter J. Winter,Analyst,"Wedbush Securities, Inc.",regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q18.pdf
answer,"Yeah, Peter. I think really focusing on improvements in the efficiency ratio is probably a better way to answer your question. We are making investments as I mentioned earlier to grow revenues, make investments in higher growth markets. We're trying to pay for that and keep our expenses relatively stable as we've mentioned for the year, which means we have to have reductions in other places to pay for those investments. So, we feel good about where we're going to end up for the year. Fourth quarter ought to be strong and we'll update you on 2019 – actually for the next three years in February.","David J.

answer,Good.,"John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q19.pdf
question,"So, I wanted to ask a handful of questions. Maybe just, first, on deposit costs. So, we saw them come down nicely on the high end of peers, 25% to 30% decline next quarter. I just wanted to double check to make sure that's based on September and the potential for an October. And I guess, you're one of the only banks we saw top quartile performance on the way up, and now, you're outperforming on the way down. So, can you maybe just talk about what you're seeing across both consumer and commercial? And if the Fed is to cut in October or beyond a couple times next year, is there further room to bring down deposit costs?",Ryan M. Nash,Analyst,Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q19.pdf
answer,"Yeah, Ryan. This is David. So, we've talked an awful lot about how to manage net interest income and margin in changing rate environments, and deposit costs being a key input. It's important to manage both. So, I'm going to start with consumer. We've done a really good job of adjusting our deposit costs, while staying competitive in the markets that we are competing in, and that's been a big driver of our deposit cost declining. I think what you'll see going forward is probably more contribution coming from the commercial side. We've done a pretty good job, a lot of those deposits are indexed. If you recall, in the first quarter, we increased deposit cost, because we had above average loan growth that we had to use deposits to fund that loan growth. That's clearly subsided, and we're looking at adjusting those deposit costs on the way down. So, we have a beta of 25% to 30% that we are giving you guidance for. And we think that'll apply to potential rate cuts that we see for the remainder of the year.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q19.pdf
question,"Got it. And then, if I could follow up on expenses. I mean, clearly, the revenue environment has been challenging. You guys are doing a better job than others to defend the margin. David, you talked about completing 16 of 67 initiatives for Simplify and Grow, and you're going have a handful more done before the end of the year, when you talked about upside, some of the areas that – the three big areas that you're saving on cost. So, as you think ahead, you're clearly holding costs stable this year, but are there enough levers for you to continue to invest in things, like technology and grow the business, and continue to hold expenses flat beyond 2019? Thanks.",Ryan M. Nash,Analyst,Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q19.pdf
answer,"So, I won't comment quite on 2020 yet, but the way we think about it is, we are continuing to make investments in talent, mortgage loan originators, commercial RMs, wealth advisors. We've continued to make investments in technology. 42% of our $625 million is spent on new things that we need to have to continue to make banking easier for our customers. We have to do that, and we will continue to do that. But in order to make room for that control cost, we have to get better at literally everything we do. So, John has asked all of us, all 20,000 people that work here, how do we get better at whatever we do tomorrow than we did yesterday, so that we can continue to make room for investments that we want to make? We have inflation in our expense base of about 2.5%. So, we have to overcome that inflation plus the investments to be able to hold our cost relatively stable, like we've done for the last couple of years. We will continue to hold our cost down. And we have a goal of efficiency, to get to the 55% range. We've mentioned that at Investor Day. We're 57.4% today. I would say, it's very challenging in a low-rate environment, but we are not giving up. We're going to continue to seek becoming more efficient as we go forward. So, there's still room to control cost into 2020.","David J.

question,Got it. Thanks for taking my questions.,Ryan M. Nash,Analyst,Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q19.pdf
answer,"Morning, Matt.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q19.pdf
question,"Hi, guys. I was wondering if you could just talk about kind of big picture how you think about balancing – protecting the profitability ratios versus growing the balance sheet. You've been keeping deposits relatively stable and it's helping them. You're obviously seeing good growth in service charges, so there's some puts and takes. But talk about the trade-off between the focus to protect the profitability, but then also thinking about trying to grow the balance sheet.",Matthew Derek O'Connor,Analyst,"Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.",regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q19.pdf
answer,"Yeah. I think it is a great question. It is very much a balance. We're focused on building a business that's going to be consistently performing, that's going to be resilient, that's going to be sustainable. And that means we've got to build a balance sheet that is resilient through every economic cycle. We've clearly traded off some growth for quality. And we'll continue to do that, Matt, as we focus on – we think it's a period of time in the economic cycle where we need to be thoughtful, careful. Client selectivity is really important to us, early identification of problems, exiting relationships that may become problematic, really important to our future. So, we talk often about the importance of soundness first, then profitability, and growth last. We are not going to grow just to grow. We don't need nominal growth. We think the balance sheet is positioned to deliver consistent and sustainable performance and the profitability that we believe will adequately reward our shareholders. And that'll continue to be our focus.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q19.pdf
answer,"Yeah. And I'll add, Matt, that we do expect to grow. As we said, we would grow low to mid-single digits in terms of loans for the year. We were up about 4.8% year-to-date on an adjusted basis, and so what we're saying is we do expect to grow. We're just not going to force growth on the balance sheet to generate nominal revenue and nominal income if the return gets hard.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q19.pdf
question,"And, I guess, just following up, I mean, you obviously had really nice loan growth in the first half of the year, a little bit of runoff this quarter. And I think one of your other portfolios might start to run off by the end of the year. And just, if you kind of put it all together in the comments that you made, what's kind of the more medium-term outlook in terms of being able to grow loans? And also, just comment on deposits as well. Thank you.",Matthew Derek O'Connor,Analyst,"Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.",regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q19.pdf
answer,"Yeah. Well, with respect to loan growth, I think, what we've said is that we anticipate growing low-single digits, typically with the economy [indiscernible] (00:24:21) in markets that we operate in. We think that, that's appropriate. If you look at year-over-year, business services loan growth has been about 7.5%. We do have some runoff portfolios in consumer, in particular. We've seen some declines in equity lending and indirect auto. We're capping our exposure to indirect unsecured lending. But we believe that our focus on continuing to build out the consumer business, at the same time, our commitment to business services lending, particularly middle market commercial lending will drive an appropriate amount of loan growth and allow us to continue to grow the assets side of the balance sheet. And with respect to deposits, we're focused on core relationships. When you look at our consumer business, we believe that 93-plus percent of our customers maintain their primary operating account with us. We're continuing to grow consumer checking accounts at a rate, we think, faster than most of our peers. Consumer demand deposits and consumer low-cost deposits, growing over time. Similarly, with a focus on small to medium-size businesses, winning their operating business, we think, we can still continue to grow low-cost deposits, which is really the core of our business and the strength of our franchise.","John M.

question,"Good morning, guys. David, can you talk a little bit about the balance sheet protection a little bit more? Just reading in the deck that you added a little bit more on the hedging side to impact – impact of lower long-term rates. So, you said the program's largely completed, I guess, can you just help us understand the math of – the magnitude of the step up that helps get the NIM up as you look from fourth to first, and then how that will cascade on its own throughout the year? Thanks.",Ken Usdin,Analyst,Jefferies LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q19.pdf
answer,"Yeah. So, I'll start, Ken, with the end in mind. We talked about the – going into next year, we think our margin could increase into the low to mid-3.40% range. We have a chart with regards to our sensitivity. Our short-term sensitivity is, take it, close to zero by the beginning of the year through all the hedges that kick-in and starting little bit in the fourth quarter, but primarily in the first part of the year. What we want to do is we have more exposure on the long end than a lot of our peers, so we want to kind of neutralize that a bit. So, we've entered into a couple billion dollars' worth of hedges that would really be – that kind of get tied in when the 10-year was in the mid to low-1.70% range to help us from the long end. And that really manifest itself in reinvestment of cash flows that come off the business every month. So, that's baked into the guidance that we're giving you. And we believe that we're not going to have a disproportionate correlation to the 10-year relative to our peers after this.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q19.pdf
question,"Okay. Got it.

Thanks, David.",Ken Usdin,Analyst,Jefferies LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q19.pdf
answer,"Yeah. So, premium amortization was relatively stable in the quarter, about $28 million in the quarter. What we did is we took some low-yielding investment securities that we could sell. We took those, we repositioned those into longer, little more duration, little more carry, to help us just again boost a little bit from an NII standpoint. But they were really lower-yielding mortgage-backed securities that we sold and reinvested. Ken Usdin Analyst, Jefferies LLC Q Thanks a lot, David.","David J.

question,"Good morning. Okay. So, couple questions. The background for the question just has to do with the longer-term outlook for RoTCE, which I know you put out at – I think, it was like 15% to 18%, is that right, at the Investor Day? And...",Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q19.pdf
answer,"Actually, 18% to 20%. Yeah [indiscernible] (00:29:00)","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q19.pdf
question,"Sorry, 18% to 20%. Yeah, 18% to 20%, sorry.",Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q19.pdf
answer,A little different interest environment.,"John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q19.pdf
question,"Yeah, exactly. So, the question that I have is how are you thinking about that? When I'm looking at it, I'm hearing, okay, you've got a lot more opportunity on the expense side, and maybe that expense – operating leverage improves as we go through the next couple of years. But then, I'm also wondering about the capital side of the equation here, and how you're thinking about that. I know you have your 9.5% target, but given the tailoring rule that came out and everything else that's been happening for banks in your size, is 9.5% still the right number for you?",Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q19.pdf
answer,"Yeah. So, I'll start with your last question. Yeah, we calculate the amount of capital we need to have based on our model. It's not regulatorily driven. And yes, we're encouraged by the tailoring relief that we have, but does not change one iota or the amount of rigor that we've put into capital planning and management. We still have, every other year, a CCAR submission. So, for the time being, 9.5% was our target. We tried to put that in our prepared comments, too. Even though our math really says, we could get to 9%, we've added 50 basis points of cushion to enable us to take advantage of opportunities, should they arise as the market uncertainty and the economic conditions continue to decline a bit. As it relates – and the 9.5% was going to allow us to get to the kind of returns we think are appropriate given the circumstances that we're under. Now, the 18% to 20% was, as John was saying in the middle of your question, that we had – that was a very different interest rate environment. We all thought rates were going to go up this year, and they clearly are down, and they're forecast to be down through the period of time we have covered by the Investor Day. So, getting to 18% to 20% would be very difficult to do without taking some unusual risk which we will not do. So, we're going to come out, and we'll update the exact targets for you later. But clearly, there's been some decline in terms of return expectations. I think that's what the stock prices in our industry have reflected. But exactly where those will be, we need to get a little better handle on where we think rates will go. We have two baked in for this year, there's probably another one coming in 2020 as well. So, more to come, Betsy.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q19.pdf

question,"Good morning. I want to see if you could talk a little bit more on the investments you're making in IT? I believe you're currently evaluating replacing your core deposit system. And so, I want to see if you can give us some details around that in terms of what's the timeframe around that type of project? What's the cost impact that we should be considering here? Could it impact next year's numbers? And then, is there other systems – are you looking at the core system on the loan side as well, or just the deposit system issue? Thank you.",John Pancari,Analyst,Evercore Group LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q19.pdf
answer,"And so, John, it's great question. We just had our strategic planning offsite meeting with the board, spent a lot of time talking about the topic. And so, I ask John Owen to address it.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q19.pdf
answer,"Yeah. Just to go back to Investor Day, we spend about $625 million a year on technology and about 1,600-plus technology professionals at the bank. And every year, at our strategic annual planning process, we go through about a three to five-year view and find out and really talk about what systems need to be upgraded, consolidated or replaced. And each year, there's about 15 systems that we identify that will need to go out and either upgrade or replace. So, this is just a normal case of business, normal course of business today. You mentioned some of the core systems around deposits. We are going to have an RFP that will go out in the first quarter for our deposit system. We'll get those results back probably midyear, and we'll make a choice on what's the right platform for us. The timeframe for that is probably a three to six-year journey for this. What you'll find with us when we do upgrade, we don't do very many big-bang upgrades. This will be an incremental approach over a multi-year time period. So, again, this is a probably a four to six-year system exchange in this particular case. I would tell you, we do about 15 of these a year. This would be a larger one, of course. But again, if you go back to our Wealth platform, we did SEI a couple years ago. We consolidated 14 systems into one. We're fortunate to operate on one consumer platform. And we're in the point of implementing [indiscernible] (00:33:58) at this point in time. So, what I would tell you, it is large. We are in the RFP process, but this is nothing that we don't do – 15 to 17, every year.",John B. Owen,Chief Operating Officer & Senior Executive Vice President,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q19.pdf
answer,"And our analysis, John, will indicate that we can complete the work within the context of our current technology spend.

Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q19.pdf
question,"Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. And then, one – I apologize, this is a little bit off the radar, a little bit, this question. But on Friday, you issued an 8-K that you announced that you're expanding your change-in-control provisions to an additional component of the management team beyond the C-suite executives. Can you give us just a little bit of color on what that relates to, and how common is it that you're modifying the change in control?",John Pancari,Analyst,Evercore Group LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q19.pdf
answer,"Yeah. Thank you for the question. I guess, we really did two things, both were intended to standardize. You can imagine, with the truest announcement, there's a lot of concern about what our future is, what our intentions are, a lot of questions about what may happen going forward. It caused us to look at our change-in-control agreements. And because the bank was the combination of a lot of banks over a long period of time, what we quickly concluded was we had a fair amount of inconsistency in our agreements, both with respect to change in control and severance. And we asked our board to consider a change in the – or modifications to both change in control and severance to make them more consistent, so they apply to both an appropriate group, and they applied similarly to that group. And so, it simply was a housecleaning sort of an initiative for us, to get everything in order. No real significant change for our shareholders, or frankly, for our associates, but it does create some consistency.","John M.

question,"Given your outlook for a continued low to mid-single digit loan growth , and clearly, you laid out a very specific path for net interest margin, is it too optimistic to think that net interest income could be flat next year?",Erika Najarian,Analyst,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q19.pdf
answer,"Well, we don't want to give guidance yet on what next year is. We can still have things that we don't know about, what the rate environment look like. Clearly, that puts pressure on growing net interest income. When you think that – and we've talked a lot about being able to grow the balance sheet consistent with GDP, and then some, then a little. Now, we've also done a lot of capital recycling to make sure that we're getting good relationship business on the books. And so, you've seen some pressure on absolute loan growth there. But we expect to grow, and our teams have that expectation. So, we had that piece of it we feel good about. Let's just see what the rate environment gives us going into next year. Lower rates obviously put some pressure on us.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q19.pdf
question,"Got it. And as I think about your earlier responses, clearly, the RoTCE range is potentially out of reach, given the interest rate outlook. But you did say, you're not giving up on 55%. And as we think about the context of revenue challenges and potentially on the – because of rate and fees potentially peaking this year, I guess, is there room for expenses on an absolute basis to actually be down to get to continued efficiency improvements?",Erika Najarian,Analyst,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q19.pdf
answer,"Well, so our commitment has been and continues to be generating positive operating leverage in any environment. So, we are seeking to grow revenue faster than the expenses. So, where revenue continues to be challenged, we'll continue to work even harder on expense management. I feel that we can do that. So, I think that, clearly, revenue is going to be challenged, kind of back to the last part, last question is – revenue will be challenged because 65% of our revenue comes from spread. And we had higher rates in the first half of the year versus the back half. And so, on a comp 2019 to 2020, it will be very hard to grow revenue in that, at least NII. So, loan growth will help us there a bit, and we'll see what the rate environment is. But, we have good NIR, we have good investments that we've made, we expect that to continue to grow. And as we just talked through, our continuous improvement program by helping control expenses, we believe, will generate positive operating leverage and continue to work our efficiency ratio down at the same time.","David J.

question,"Hey. Hi. Good morning, guys. A couple questions. First, more of a clarification. The 25% to 30% deposit beta in the fourth quarter, what's the denominator on that? Is that on two cuts, and hence, it's a 12 to 15-basis-point reduction in deposit costs? It's not – I'm just trying to make sure it's not on an average Fed Funds rate, because obviously, out of July and September cut, that's fully in the fourth quarter. I just want to make sure I understand the numerator and denominator there.",Saul Martinez,Analyst,UBS Securities LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q19.pdf
answer,"Yeah. So, it's based on two rate cuts that are baked in October and December right now.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q19.pdf
question,"Okay. So, it would be a 12 to 15-basis-point reduction?",Saul Martinez,Analyst,UBS Securities LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q19.pdf
answer,"Round number, that's right.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q19.pdf
question,"Okay. Got it. I guess, more important question on loan growth. I hear what you're saying that over the long run – or under normal conditions, you can grow your balance sheet in line with what – and hopefully then some. But if I look at your loan growth this quarter, period end, it was up, I think, 1% year-on-year. Going forward, you have indirect vehicles rolling off, tune maybe a few hundred a quarter. You have GreenSky as a headwind. Home equity, still a little bit of a headwind. Your CRE book isn't really growing. It's contracting, I think, on mortgage owner-occupied. I mean, I'm struggling with how you get loan growth and interest-earning asset growth next year. Can you just – hope we understand where you see the offset, where – I know you're not giving guidance for 2020, but how do I think about it conceptually, given you have pretty material headwinds in multiple loan lines?",Saul Martinez,Analyst,UBS Securities LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q19.pdf
answer,"So, there's a lot of stories inside the loan book. Let's kind of start at the top. So, our big driver of loan growth has traditionally been our C&I book. Those can be lumpy from time to time. It depends on access to capital markets. It depends on line utilization, and you've seen some of that happening this year. I mean, it's – we had a lot of growth in the first quarter and no growth in the second and the third quarter. We feel good about our pipelines. We feel good about our conversations we're having with our clients. They are cautious. They're optimistic, but they're watching this uncertainty with regards to trade and tariffs. Clearly put some pressure and downward sentiment in terms of wanting to make the next dollar fixed capital investment. But that being said, we still think there's going to be some growth there. From an investor real estate standpoint, we've probably had the second lowest concentration of investor real estate of our peers. We have some opportunities there. We're being very careful in selecting these clients. And so from time to time, you'll see that move up, and then payoffs will move it back down. But I think investor real estate is an opportunity. Resi mortgage continues to be an opportunity. We had a little bit of growth this quarter. Production was up. About a third of that was refinance, and two-thirds of it was purchase. And we keep about almost half of what we produce. So I think that'll be a plus in our direct consumer. We think it's going to be a plus. We're making investments in unsecured. Even though GreenSky is running off, we have other avenues. I think John mentioned, we're going to cap unsecured, but we continue to see opportunities for a little bit of growth there. Now, home equity has been on quite a bit of decline over time, and we think that'll slow down a bit. So, I think that when you – and you had mentioned indirect vehicles being down, those are really the key drivers. Again, we're not looking for a lot of loan growth, but I think we'll have solid loan growth that'll be profitable for the company.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q19.pdf
question,"The GreenSky is roughly $2 billion, I believe? And how quickly does it – what's the weighted average life of that?",Saul Martinez,Analyst,UBS Securities LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q19.pdf
answer,"Yeah. It's about $1.9 billion actually. And it has a little – right at two years in terms of duration. There'll be pieces of this that linger for a while, but the bulk of that is two years.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q19.pdf
answer,"And, Saul, it begins to run off. We've modestly increased our commitment to SoFi to grow that portfolio. And we are investing in our own unsecured lending capabilities. And we believe that we can match the timing of the runoff and the increase in SoFi with unsecured lending capabilities, all of which should help us on the consumer side in addition to growing mortgage, growing bank card and the growing direct lending.","John M.

answer,Good. Thank you.,"John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q19.pdf
question,"Can you guys share with us, we hear – and you guys already touched on your technology spend. I think you had mentioned $625 million is what is expected to be expense this year. How can we, as outsiders – we hear a lot of stories about the big banks taking market share from the smaller banks. How do you guys measure whether you're keeping – I know the dollars you're spending, but how do you measure whether you're keeping up from a digital, technological standpoint that you can remain competitive with the bigger banks? What are some of the metric should we outsiders look to, to determine whether you're keeping up with these bigger banks?",Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q19.pdf
answer,"Yeah. Just real quick on that, this is John Owen. Like I said earlier, we spend about $625 million. About 42% of that is based on new initiatives and new projects and looking forward into new things, which digital would be a big part of that. About 48% is around how do we maintain the bank, maintain systems and really our infrastructure going forward. About 10% is on cyber risk. The way we think about, are we keeping up and keeping pace, we use a few external factors. Number one would be J.D. Powers. J.D. Powers (sic) [J.D. Power. J.D. Power] ranks all the – top 23 banks are on their list, and they come out with a quarterly ranking. And they rank everything from how we perform in the branch, all the way through to our online banking and mobile banking. So, that's a data point we use consistently. We're in the top quartile for branch. And online/mobile moves between top quartile and second quartile. So, again, that's an area where we're trying to always keep that in the top quartile. The other source would be Gallup. Gallup also gives us good insights from our customers on how we're performing in digital and areas where we need to advance. And the other thing I would point to is just the rapid growth of our digital at the bank. Over the last three years, our digital logins to our online and mobile properties were up 90%. You heard John talk about earlier on digital sales. Our digital sales are up 90% year-over-year in credit card. Our digital sales and savings accounts were up 35%, and checking accounts about 24%. So, we kind of look at it from a couple of factors, how do our external parties validate what we're doing and also our internal growth rates.",John B. Owen,Chief Operating Officer & Senior Executive Vice President,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q19.pdf
answer,"Yeah. I'll just add, Gerard. The other thing I look at is how we're growing consumer checking accounts. Are we growing low-cost deposits and who are our new customers. And roughly, half of our new customers are under the age of 30. And so, all of those things, for me, are indicators that we are, in fact, competing and having success, offering compelling technology to our customers.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q19.pdf
question,"Very good. And David, you talked a bit about the CECL increase you mentioned, you guys put out the number in the second quarter Q. I think you said, $400 million to $600 million, which if you compare that to your existing level of reserves, it's over a 50% increase. Everybody appears to be able to handle, yourself included, the Day 1 impact that you just described. How can you frame out for us, if you can, what the Day 2 impacts are going to look like? Should we, as outsiders, assume that we're going to see loan loss provisions of similar increases to what the Day 1 impact was for everybody, or how are you guys looking at that at this stage?",Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q19.pdf
answer,"Yeah. I would not say that Day 2 would be anything remotely close to Day 1. Day 1 just kind of level sets. And we'll see what other peers are coming out and what their numbers are. Really, it's dependent on portfolios. Those with consumer or longer-dated loans are going to have higher CECL charges than those that are business services oriented that have shorter-term duration of their loan books. Day 2, you need to think about you still have charge-offs to come through. You have to provide CECL reserves and provisioning on loan growth. Those have the tendency to be somewhat higher than we have today under the incurred model, and again, very dependent on what type of loans you're growing. So, mix makes a big difference. So, if you're growing mortgages versus commercial real estate, mortgages are going to carry a higher provision than commercial real estate as odd as that sounds. And then, the last key factor is what's the economic outlook? How is that changing from time to time? And that's why we've put in our prepared comments. We've given you $400 million to $600 million, but it's really dependent on what it looks like December 31, last January 1. What do we think the forecast looks like going forward, that makes a big difference. And in Day 2, when that change occurs, things getting better or worse, you see, in particular, when they get worse or forecasted to get worse, you can see much bigger provisions then than you do on the incurred model and that's what the standard was supposed to do. It was trying to have you reserve much quicker, and that's why we've talked about procyclicality. The standard is as procyclical as you can get because in a down rate cycle, you're going to be reserving more for loan growth, which causes one to be concerned about the cost and availability of credit in a downturn.","David J.

answer,"Brian, good morning.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q19.pdf
question,"Hi, everyone. I guess I actually had a couple of questions on your slide appendix. First of all, thank you for this level of detail on the commercial loan portfolio or some of the key areas you're highlighting. It is quite a lot. I guess, as I'd looked through slide 14 – really, maybe 15 through 17, because the energy you've talked about before, the restaurant, the retail, the manufacturing, transportation, how are you positioning this? Is this just being responsive to investor questions, or are these areas you're actively concerned? Are there any sub-portfolios where you're seeing opportunity to maybe take some market share? I guess how should I interpret all this detail why you're highlighting restaurant, retail, manufacturing, and transportation?",Brian D. Foran,Analyst,Autonomous Research US LP,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q19.pdf
answer,"Brian, this is Barb Godin. On that note, we do have some concerns in the restaurant portfolio, that we're seeing some softening in the restaurant portfolio. There's certainly been some softening in the energy portfolio, a little bit in manufacturing. But by and large, we decided to be much more transparent, providing you with information on our portfolios, so that all of you have an opportunity to look and say, look, we see what's in their portfolio, we feel good about their portfolio, we feel good about our portfolios and our ability to manage it. And we just felt that now was the time to be, as I said, much more transparent, particularly as we go into what potentially looks like a credit cycle that'll happen in the next couple of years.",Barbara I. Godin,"Senior Executive Vice President, Deputy Chief Risk Officer and Chief Credit Officer",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q19.pdf
question,"And then, maybe in a similar vein on slide 12, I mean, I almost hate to ask this, but it's always a little bit of a lightning rod for investors, the leverage loan balances. Certainly, recognizing the $6 billion is much bigger number than the standard definition of what would produce $2.5 billion that you highlight in the slides. But I think when you first gave this, it was about $5.5 billion. So, why has it kind of crept up a little bit over the past six to nine months? Is that you participating more, or is that just some credits tripping into your leverage definition? Why has the number gotten a little bigger?",Brian D. Foran,Analyst,Autonomous Research US LP,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q19.pdf
answer,"Yeah. We do have a number of credits, but again based on the way we define it, will become leveraged even though they started off as not leveraged. Additionally, we've got Ronnie Smith here who runs that portfolio, and I'm going to ask him to make a couple of comments on them.",Barbara I. Godin,"Senior Executive Vice President, Deputy Chief Risk Officer and Chief Credit Officer",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q19.pdf
answer,"Just a couple of comments. And one of your responses is exactly on target. We had a couple of really long-term relationships, publicly-traded companies that had positive credit events that pushed it over into our definition of leverage lending. And if you combine those two, it was just over $400 million. We feel good about those particular companies, and we'll see at least one of those resolved within a very short period of time. The other will resolve, given a little bit more intermediate period of time, but there's not really a focus on growing that portfolio other than continuing to support our existing relationships, where we can build broad and deep relationships outside of the lending transaction only.",Ronald G. Smith,Senior Executive Vice President & Head of Corporate Banking Group,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q19.pdf
answer,"I'd just add we actually have managed it as a concentration risk, like we do every other part of our portfolio.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q19.pdf

answer,Thank you.,"John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q19.pdf
answer,"Good morning, Christopher.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q19.pdf
question,"Hey, good morning. Wanted to ask further on the credit explanation you just gave. Should we see a higher level of total criticized than we do now, or will that number kind of vary? I know you had the spec change driving a lot of this quarterly shifts.",Christopher Marinac,Analyst,Janney Montgomery Scott LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q19.pdf
answer,"Yeah. It's Barb again. In the criticized portfolio, in particular, classified, I think, is what you're pointing to, which drove that number up. Let me first start with saying, despite all that, our credit metrics for the quarter were within our broader risk expectation. We experienced improvement in several areas. As you know, delinquencies were down 4%, TDR was down 7%, NPL was down 13% and charge-offs were flat, so we feel good there. And as well, as you mentioned, David did our shared national credits were included. And just to comment on the shared national credits, we weren't agent on any of those credits, by the way. If I speak specifically to our classified loan category, I'm going to categorize what happened this quarter as follows, which is really over half of the increase came from five energy credits that moved into this category. But since quarter-end, one of these credits has been totally resolved, and the other three credits are to a large energy services customer that stays with us for well over 50 years. And they have the proven ability to perform through the cycle. So, for energy, in general, I'll make a comment that our book right now is only 13% oilfield services. And we also have gone through and stressed our price deck, on which we both lend as well as service our accounts down to $39.20, and that's against today's price. The last I looked this morning, it was about $54 a barrel, give or take. So, based on all of this, we've done a lot of work, we believe our energy losses will stay somewhere within a really manageable range of about $30 million to $50 million over the next three years. In addition to energy, we also had some asset-based loans that we moved to classified this quarter, with all of them currently being well within their asset values. So, as such, we anticipate minimal to no loss on those credits. And lastly, we also reviewed the top 80% of credits that moved to our classified category this quarter. And again, based on this, we're comfortable with both our loss range of 40 to 50 basis points for this year and 40 to 65 basis points over the next year based on a falling economy. So, I'd summarize by saying we don't see what happened this quarter as being a systemic issue. We are, however, coming off the period of historically low numbers. And as such, we believe that some increase was to be expected.",Barbara I. Godin,"Senior Executive Vice President, Deputy Chief Risk Officer and Chief Credit Officer",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q19.pdf
answer,"I'll add, Barb, the 40 to 65 basis points loss rate was over the next three years.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q19.pdf

question,"Okay. Great. That's helpful background. And again, with the inclusion of the additional categories, does that imply that restaurants and ABL and others had deterioration in the quarter, or again, you're just giving more transparency to those in general?",Christopher Marinac,Analyst,Janney Montgomery Scott LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q19.pdf
answer,"There's some marginal deterioration, but we're really are just trying to get much more transparency.",Barbara I. Godin,"Senior Executive Vice President, Deputy Chief Risk Officer and Chief Credit Officer",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q19.pdf

answer,"Morning, Stephen.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q19.pdf
question,"Yeah. Good morning. Thanks. I just had a follow-up question, maybe to Betsy's earlier question around the RoTCE guidance, and kind of just maybe more specifically, why that would move down. I just remember from your Investor Day, you guys had a pretty – not negative, but maybe muted view on the economy, kind of where GDP was going to go. Fed Funds reverting to a zero-range policy and even a 10-year, I think, around 1.50%. So, granted a lot of what we're seeing today is kind of what you guys predicted, so I'm wondering what specifically is driving the change in expectations relative to what you said then?",Stephen Kendall Scouten,Analyst,Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_3Q19.pdf
answer,"Yeah. I think, Stephen, our expectation in the 10-year was closer to 3% than the 1.50% at the time we gave that out. So, there are two things that drive returns, the numerator and denominator. And that denominator impact on lower rates is pretty tough. When you have a falling rate environment, clearly, the fair value of the investment portfolio, and therefore, book value increases. And that's the same thing in all the derivatives that we've added. The fair value of those have obviously increased, putting pressure on the denominator. So, that's more meaningful than you might think when you go through the calculation. From a net income standpoint, clearly, we had rate expectations and margin guidance that had been as high as 3.70% down to low-3.40%. That's where we are. And so, 18% to 21%, predicated on being at the low end of the range. So, I think if you look at our industry and you think of just good core commercial banking, a 20% return on capital can get you – you can get there when you have a rising rate environment margins are continuing to expand. We don't have that. We have low rates, a relatively flat yield curve, and at least the market's saying, no real expectations for rates to change over the next couple of years. So, it's really hammering out net income growth and return through making good investments to grow NIR and watching expenses, keeping your tabs on credit quality, and that's what we're doing. But it's – you can't get to those type of returns in this environment, if it persists.","David J.

question,"Good morning. Regarding the investment program, I know you're going to give us a little bit more details later on, but in general, how are you thinking about the ultimate tax reform benefit and how much of that gets deployed into the program? And accordingly, how much eventually fall through the bottom line? Thanks.",John Pancari,Analyst,Evercore Group LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q17.pdf
answer,"Yeah, John, so, it's David. We wanted to give you some flavor for that. If you look at our expectation for return on tangible common equity, we've moved that up 200 basis points from 12% to 14% to 14% to 16%. We anticipated some tax reform coming. We believe that it was appropriate at the time to increase our capital expenditures to accelerate some opportunities, we think we have to better serve our customer. Those capital expenditures, they don't find their way into the income statement. They'll find themselves in an income statement over time. So, we have that baked into our guidance already. And we had our other initiatives where we made contributions to our foundation and our $15 for minimum wage, because we think it was important for us to continue to execute on our mission of shared values, which is taking care of customers and associates and communities, as well as our shareholders.","David J.

question,"Okay, So, no percentage reinvestment amount that you're willing to give?",John Pancari,Analyst,Evercore Group LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q17.pdf
answer,"No. We – our – we increased our capital expenditures roughly [ph] in (00:29:06) $100 million. Right now, you can see that we're keeping our targets for Common Equity Tier 1 where they are. Therefore, the benefit that we see coming through from taxes will help increase our return on tangible common, that 200 basis points.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q17.pdf
question,"Got it. Okay. I was just getting there, if there is anything else beyond the CapEx amount. Okay. And the separately, in terms of capital deployment, I just want to hop to that. Wanted to get your updated thoughts around interest in M&A, as you're looking at opportunities here. Can you remind us of your deployment priorities? How you're thinking about that right now and where does M&A come into play both non-bank and bank? Thanks.",John Pancari,Analyst,Evercore Group LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q17.pdf
answer,"Yeah. So, our priorities really haven't changed, John. We focus first and foremost on organic growth. It's important for us to take the capital we generate, put it back into the growth and the business appropriately. When we have opportunities to get an appropriate risk adjusted return from that organic growth, we've been very disciplined with regards to not just making any loan but making the loans that give our shareholders the appropriate risk-adjusted return. We will continue doing that. Second, we wanted to make sure we have a fair dividend to our shareholders. We had talked about being in the range of earnings of 30% to 40%, and that we would be increasing that to 35% to 45% over time. We believe that's important. So as income increases, whether it'd be through tax savings or otherwise, you should expect that to find its way into that dividend calculation. Then, we said we would look at opportunities to expand through non-bank acquisitions. We've had a number of those, [indiscernible] (00:31:00) business; First Sterling, our low-income housing tax credit syndicator business, which was basically on ice this year, but we're looking forward to that expansion this year with tax reform. So, that's been important. Bank M&A, given the fact that we have excess capital, we really have to look at banks versus share buybacks, and we believe that the share buyback program that we've had going on will continue and that we will continue to work our capital ratios down to that Common Equity Tier 1 level of roughly 9.5%. As credit quality and de-risking continues, perhaps that number changes, perhaps could maybe go lower. If we tag on more risk, the number will go higher. But right now, our goal is to get back to 9.5%","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q17.pdf
answer,"John, I think that it's a great question, and if we look at how income state was generating more capital, how do we deploy that capital most constructively and most productively, and as David said, our first and foremost is organic, is making sure that we can – if we can put that capital back into our business constructively and productively, we'll do that. If we can't do that, obviously, we look at M&A and our primary focus has been bolt-on non-bank M&A. We continue to look at that. Secondarily, we look at bank M&A, but we've had the economics of that make it particularly challenging at this point in time. We look at it. But our primary focus after we've gotten through the organic is – and the bolt-on acquisitions is, really to look at how do we give it back in the form of dividend and share repurchases. We want a competitive dividend, and we want share repurchases, as a lever to use when we can't deploy that capital in the other way, and we still – knowing what we know today, we still think that's going to be a productive and constructive use of the capital we're generating.","O.

question,"Hey. Good morning, guys. How are you doing? Just a question on the balance sheet. Thinking through the organic growth in loans and deposits, and then, the lingering runoff that you articulated clearly, how do we just think about the trajectory of the balance sheet? The balance sheet is clearly becoming more efficient, but do you expect – I guess when – should we see any average earning asset expansion this year? Or is it just kind of netting those – a final kind of mix to a better place?",Ken Usdin,Analyst,Jefferies LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q17.pdf
answer,"Yeah. So, we've given you some guidance on low-single digits on the balance sheet for loans and deposits. We see that continuing. We have not changed that guidance post tax reform. We'll see what demand for credit might look like, but right now, we feel pretty confident we can grow in the low-single digits on both of those. We do have the headwind of our indirect auto book that will affect us about $700 million, as I previously mentioned. But we can overcome that...","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q17.pdf
question,Right.,Ken Usdin,Analyst,Jefferies LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q17.pdf
answer,"...and continue to grow, and grow the balance sheet both in dollars but also, as you mentioned, it's far more effective and efficient in generating better returns for us.","David J.

answer,"Yeah, I mean, I think...","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q17.pdf
question,And that sort of – yeah.,Ken Usdin,Analyst,Jefferies LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q17.pdf
answer,"We're very pleased with sort of the super progress we've made on reshifting our balance sheet and the assets we've invested in. Clearly in 2016, 2017, we made some risk-based decisions regarding our balance sheet and reduced our risk appetite for certain asset classes, which created a headwind for us in terms of loan growth. We had very good loan production growth in 2017. That production actually strengthened in the second half of the year. We felt good about that. What we have not built into the guidance is any sort of optimism about loan growth above and beyond what we're seeing today is if business is more certain and more confident in 2018, then they have been thus far – that's an upside opportunity. But for right now, we've built in what we know and what we see. Obviously, we'd be encouraged if it is better than that. We've John Turner with us. John, do you mind making a few comments about the potential for loan growth?","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q17.pdf
answer,"Sure, Grayson. Happy to. As this has been suggested, we are currently projecting sort of low-single digit loan growth. That is based upon our assessment of economic conditions, market conditions prior to, as has been said, any tax reform. I would say that we are largely complete with the de-risking activities. We'll continue to focus on improving the quality of our portfolio, on client selectivity, on risk-adjusted returns in the business. And so, I anticipate that we will see just, as a result of better execution, continued improvement in execution for that low- single digit growth. And if the economy does in fact pick up as a result of tax reform, then we should benefit from that. But in the meantime, we do believe we can deliver low-single digit growth just based upon our day to day activities and expectations of the business.",John Turner,President & Head of Corporate Banking Group,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q17.pdf
question,"Great. Understood. Thanks on all of that. And then, inside that efficiency comment, can you – is there a way you can help us separate how much that efficiency can help the NIM itself on its own versus how much rates can help the NIM, presuming the curve and the hikes that you're expecting?",Ken Usdin,Analyst,Jefferies LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q17.pdf
answer,"I'm not exactly sure of your question, but let me see if I can give it a stab. So our efficiency ratio, we have a number of things we're going to have to deal with. The tax equivalent adjustment that we have does negatively impact the efficiency ratio, as it does the margin. So I told you the 4 basis points of the margin, but it also negatively impact the efficiency ratio about 50 basis points.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q17.pdf
question,"50 bps, right.",Ken Usdin,Analyst,Jefferies LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q17.pdf
answer,"50 bps, but we're still committed to having an efficiency ratio under that 60% that we mentioned. So, that will come from continuing to become more efficient. On expenses, we did a good job of having a less than 1% growth in expenses this year. We see renewed growth and revenue coming. We gave you the guidance of 3% to 5% on NII. We feel good about that based on the balance sheet growth and even more encouraged based on what we've seen off late with the market expectations for rates. And we also are getting back on the growth side of non- interest revenue, where we were down this year, but expect 3% to 6% growth in non-interest revenue. So, if you put all of that together, and we'll get some incremental benefits from the Simplify and Grow strategy that we talked about. We feel pretty confident, we can be under 60%.","David J.

answer,"Good morning, Geoffrey.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q17.pdf
question,"Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, if I look back at the 3Q presentation, you told about additional expense reductions beyond the $400 million, details to be provided later in the year. We're on the 4Q call in January, and it sounds like you've announced Simplify and Grow as a name project. But in terms of getting real financial details behind that, we're going to have to wait later into 2018. Has something changed that means you are taking a deeper look or are you thinking about things in a different way than you were back in October when you put out that 3Q presentation?",Geoffrey Elliott,Analyst,Autonomous Research LLP,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q17.pdf
answer,"No, Geoff, there's usually been no change on our perspective. As we talked about this in the third quarter, as you mentioned in your comments, we've been on a multi-year journey of really trying to manage expenses very rigorously and with a lot of discipline. We absolutely are confident. We've done a good job of that. That being said, what we announced in the third quarter is, we were going to bring McKinsey in to help us take an even harder look at that. And we embarked on those work streams as John Owen spoke about a moment ago. It's been a very in-depth evaluation. We've had people across the company involved in it and these things are best done very thoughtfully and very carefully. And we've taken our time to do that. And we're in the middle of execution at this point in time. And there's [indiscernible] (00:40:29), but nothing's changed from our perspective, everything's on schedule just as we had forecasted it would be.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q17.pdf
question,"And I guess, the long-term ROTCE target, it sounds like that's 14% to 16% long term, but also 2018 target, if I am reading slide 13 right. So, is there a scope to take another look at that based on Simplify and Grow?",Geoffrey Elliott,Analyst,Autonomous Research LLP,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q17.pdf
answer,"Yeah. So, that 14% to 16% was a 2018 target. It was not necessarily a longer term target. We do expect, as I've mentioned before, we're in the 12% to 14% range that we will continue to move up expectations that we move up towards the mid-teens on return on tangible common. Since then, we've had tax reform. We've also had Simply and Grow. So, we will give you better guidance above 14% to – or that range 14% to 16% as that becomes known. We will be doing another Investor Day roughly this time next year. We'll give you a new three-year set of targets. We'll show you how we compare to the original set of targets that we gave you. But now, we expect that to continue to grow past 2018's results.","David J.

answer,"Good morning, Jennifer.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q17.pdf
question,Good morning. Could you just talk about what you think the main drivers of your forecasted fee income growth will be this year? And...,Jennifer Demba,Analyst,"SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.",regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q17.pdf
answer,"Sure. Sure. So, as you looked at the detail of our non-interest revenue, we got out of the box a little slower in terms of our capital markets business. It recovered quite nicely in the fourth quarter. And as we've said in our prepared comments, we expect that capital markets in particular to be helpful to our 3% to 6% growth in 2018. We do have – our service charges have been a very stable component of our non-interest revenue. We grew that about a little over 2%, almost 3% a year. We expect that to contribute as we continue to grow core checking account households. Card and ATM fees, we continue to grow those both in terms of sheer numbers. Transactions are up. So, that'll be a piece of it. Our Wealth Management group in particularly in the investment management trust area has continued to benefit from growth in customers, as well as assets under management. So that'll be a piece of it. We think mortgage will rebound. We think mortgage will be up nicely from the production that we had this year. It was kind of a reset we believe for the industry. So, you should see mortgage continuing to rebound as well. Those are kind of the bigger items that we have that should contribute to that 3% to 6% growth.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q17.pdf
question,Okay. Thank you very much.,Jennifer Demba,Analyst,"SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.",regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q17.pdf
answer,"Good morning, Steve.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q17.pdf
question,"Good morning. Circling back to loan growth, just wondering, how we should think about it; steady throughout the year, or perhaps backend weighted? And then, what do you think will be the primary drivers of growth, C&I and commercial real estate or Consumer?",Stephen M. Moss,Analyst,B. Riley FBR Inc.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q17.pdf
answer,"I think when you look at the 2018 and you think through, when loan demand occurs, I would tell you, there's still an awful a lot of liquidity in the markets. And if you look at 2017 as an example, we've started off with the year in pretty good shape from a production pipeline standpoint. In the second half of the year, we wound up having an awful lot of payoffs and paydowns, as people went into the public debt markets. We saw the [ph] strength of that (00:44:53) stronger in the third than in the fourth, but still elevated. And so, I do think that there's still a lot of liquidity that's out there and so there is competition for that. Internally, we've had debates about the implications of tax reform and what that has on loan demand. We don't see that changing really what's occurring on the Consumer side of the house. Consumer is a good story and it's a steady story, other than the headwinds that we have from the indirect auto run-off portfolio we've got, it's a good story. Even in mortgage, 2017 turned out to be a very transformational year for mortgage, as that market went from a refinance market to a home purchase market, but we've always been a strong home purchase mortgage originator. And so most of the impact of that will be passed to us in 2017 on the Consumer side. The only lingering effect we've got on Consumer is just the indirect auto piece. On the commercial side, we put together our forecast based on what we know today. If the economy strengthens – as John Turner said earlier, if the economy strengthens, we've got an upside opportunity, but knowing what we know today, we think the forecast that we've given you, the guidance we give you, we've got a fairly high degree of confidence in it. John Turner, would you like to add to that?","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q17.pdf
answer,"Yeah. Yeah, I would just add, typically the second and four quarters are going to be our better quarters. We began the year with a lot of momentum coming off of a high degree of production in the fourth quarter. So, pipelines are a little softer going into the year, but funding should be a little better in the first quarter, given that activity in the fourth. We have confidence in our ability to deliver commercial banking and commercial lending activity this year. I think the difference is going to be that we have been shrinking, de-risking our investor real estate book, and we have an opportunity to grow that business with the economy, particularly as we see our term lending program begin to mature a bit, as we shift our focus on a different type real estate customer. We're beginning to see some of that positive activity. So, that will have an impact on loan growth as well in 2018.",John Turner,President & Head of Corporate Banking Group,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q17.pdf
question,"Okay. And then, on asset quality this quarter, nice improvement in the numbers. Wondering how much of that pay downs versus risk-weighted improvements and how should we think about the loan loss reserve going forward.",Stephen M. Moss,Analyst,B. Riley FBR Inc.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q17.pdf
answer,Barb Godin?,"O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q17.pdf
answer,"Yeah. This is Barb. And to answer your question directly, roughly 50% of what we saw in terms of the improvement in our business services classified loan book was payoff to pay down. The balance was just creating improvements and it is a broad based, it wasn't specific to just the energy sector. We certainly saw some improvement in energy, but we saw it right across the board and all the various asset classes. As it relates to the allowance, going to 1.17%, again, we follow a very formulaic way of doing our allowance. And you've heard me say in the past, we're not going to let it fall substantially, but at the same time, we do have to ensure that we have the right amount of allowance against the right amount of risk. So I don't have a specific number for you that we either target or aim for. We just make sure that the allowance we do have is appropriate and prudent at all times.",Barbara I. Godin,Chief Credit Officer & Senior Executive Vice President,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q17.pdf
answer,"And I would add that, we gave you some guidance on the charge-offs being in the range of 35 basis points to 50 basis points. And based on what we know today, we think we would have charge-offs closer to the lower end of that, and you should think about provisioning equal to charge offs in that case. To the extent it's higher than that, you probably have something that happened in a hurricane or energy type reserve, where the reserve is already there, and didn't have to be replaced.","David J.

answer,"Good morning, Gerard.","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q17.pdf
question,"Hi. Good morning. This is actually Steven Duong in for Gerard. Thanks for taking our questions. Just circling back on your comments about capital expenditures. You said you're looking to increase CapEx, which should help you boost your ROTCE target. What are these investments exactly? And is it safe to assume that they're capitalized, so they won't show in the P&L?",Steven Duong,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q17.pdf
answer,"Yeah. So, the – so, a couple of things. The CapEx, roughly $100 million is over what we had in 2016. Those capital expenditures are really in areas that help make it easier for our customers to do business with us, that help us generate revenue. Don't tie that necessarily to return at least directly. We believe there are a lot of opportunities. These capital expenditures are exactly that, and they hit the balance sheet, they'll be depreciated over time. And depending on the nature of the project, they could be long dated, they could be tied to a branch. It may be tied to digital opportunities, it may be tied to cyber risk efforts. So, those – that number or that increase you should think about again hitting the balance sheet, but not hitting the income statement, but a little bit each year. And that's after it's spent, it'll be this year that we spend it. So, you won't see hardly any of that income this year.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q17.pdf
answer,"But, Steven, you're seeing a lot of our customers really start to have a high utilization rate in our digital channels. And so, obviously, those customers' expectations are being influenced probably by other banks they use, but other providers for other services. And so, we're having to compare ourselves to a larger community. We talk about digital, and so, we make investments there. We also have a number of technologies that we use to help us manage risk and compliance. And so, we have to continue to invest in those, continue to strength them and make them better each and every year, and cyber being one of the lead candidates there. But lastly, I would tell you is, coming out of this Simplify and Grow initiative, we've identified a lot of places where technology can help us be not only more effective, but much more efficient. And so, you're going to see us continue to invest in technology as we go through that initiative. And last, but certainly not least is, if you go into some of our branches, the technology we're deploying in our new branch format is entirely different than what we've had in the past. We've done a number of branches in the past in 2016 and 2017, but you'll see us accelerate that into 2018. Huge benefit from us from a customer service perspective and a customer experience perspective when they come into one of our offices. Steven Duong Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC Q Great. Thank you for the color on that. And just a follow-up question. You guys are trading at about 1.3 three times book, 2 times tangible book. Is there a price level where the buybacks don't make as much sense relative to the other opportunities that you have?","O. B. Grayson Hall, Jr.","Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q17.pdf
answer,"We continue to challenge ourselves on that very point, but we're sitting here with a pretty high Common Equity Tier 1 ratio relative to the risk that we have in the balance sheet. And so, when you have excess capital, it's hard to see how the market gives you full credit for being optimized on your capital stack. And so, we have to have a pretty high return hurdle for us to deviate from buying back our shares versus making some other type investment. So, when you get to the efficient frontier having your capital amount, your capital stack optimized and you got a different calculus, but for us, getting to that 9.5% is very important to us.

answer,"Yeah, Chris. It's David. We do not have any relief in our – in the numbers we just told you from LCR, to the extent that the SIFI designation was changed and, therefore, we weren't subject to LCR. There are some deposits that were fairly low-cost deposits for us that, based on the rules, the run-off assumptions, caused us to price those where they weren't as favorable to us and we let those run off. So, LCR certainly would be somewhat beneficial to us. It would help us more from a liquidity standpoint where we could generate more liquidity there.

answer,"So, Steve, we've – it's David. We continue to look at our asset sensitivity and think about what the rate environment would be.

Now, we have put some hedges on as we've discussed in previous quarters that we have forward starting to help us manage what we think the rate environment might look like out a couple of years from here or a year and change from here. Such that, we get to a point where we're getting more neutral at that time, now we still think the Fed is going to be data dependent in terms of what they may do on raising rates in the short term, so we think still being asset sensitive at the moment is the right place for us to be.

question,...if you look at 2019? Thanks.,John Eamon McDonald,Analyst,Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q18.pdf
answer,"Yeah. We ended the year with a really very strong quarter particularly on the wholesale side of the business. And as a result, you saw an increase in ending loan balances because quite a bit of the activity was towards the end of the year. The loan growth was really well-balanced, as we referred to earlier, across most of our segments within the industries. We grew our energy, our power utilities groups, technology and defense, financial services, our government institutional banking groups. So a number of areas where we have specialized expertise across both our corporate and our commercial banking platforms grew during the quarter. Within real estate, we grew our term lending portfolio which has now been an important strategic initiative of ours. We're beginning to see much better balance between term lending production and construction originations. And within that category of term lending, we grew office and we grew industrial, broadly across our geographic footprint. So it was a good quarter, production was up significantly over the prior quarters. As a result of that, we ended the year where the pipeline is a little softer than we began the fourth quarter with. We're guiding toward low single digit loan growth again, given that we'll have puts and takes within the portfolio. We continue to focus on portfolio optimization, on risk adjusted returns and improving the quality of the portfolio. And so we don't expect, John, to grow much more than GDP plus possibly a little. That's our plan. And if we do that, we can achieve all the financial objectives that we set out. John Eamon McDonald Analyst, Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC Q Okay. Thank you.","John M.

question,"Hi. I was just wondering on the service charges, you had real nice growth year-over-year. And remind us [ph] does it have any (00:23:09) price increases or was the year-ago level depressed or anything?",Matthew Derek O'Connor,Analyst,"Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.",regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q18.pdf
answer,"Hey, Matt. It's David. No. It's really not price increases, service charges have a tendency to follow our account growth. And our focus on growing core checking accounts has really been a hallmark of our franchise, and we continue to see that. And as a result, the service charges have responded favorably.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q18.pdf
answer,"Consumer checking growth, [ph] now it's (00:23:37) up about 1.3%. And as David says with that comes, service charge activity, debit card usage and other things, all of which have been very positive.","John M.

question,"Okay. And then just [ph] hopefully (00:23:49) on credit quality, the charge-offs did pick up a little bit I think some of it was coming from home equity. Is there any noise from recent hurricanes that might be distorting that?",Matthew Derek O'Connor,Analyst,"Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.",regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q18.pdf
answer,I'll let Barb answer that.,"John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q18.pdf
answer,"Yeah. No, there's very little if anything that came from the hurricanes this time which we were blessed on. The charge-offs that we saw, the increase between this quarter and last quarter quite frankly was expected given the seasonality in the consumer portfolio and reflects our focus in the past several quarters on some of the higher yielding products that we have in consumer. We're getting appropriately paid for the risk. So again, we feel pretty good about the credit quality.",Barbara I.

question,"I know you're going to provide us more detail in a month and a half or so at your Investor Day, but I'm wondering as we think about our two-year earnings outlook for Regions, should we look forward to continued efficiency improvement? And can that efficiency improvement occur even if the revenue environment becomes more challenging than budgeted?",Erika Najarian,Analyst,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q18.pdf
answer,"Hey, Erika, we've done a pretty good job of managing our expense base, as well as growing revenue evidenced through our simplifying road continuous improvement process. That is a journey it's not a program, where we continue to look at every aspect of our business in terms of how we can improve every single day. We have a number of projects on the table today that we will continue to benefit from. Clearly, our goal is to improve our efficiency ratio. We had talked about over time getting into the mid-50s. We're going to talk a little bit more about that at our Investor Day as you mentioned. But clearly, there's aspects of revenue growth and expense management in that. As revenue becomes more challenge, we have to continue to look for ways to get to that efficiency ratio. We feel pretty confident we can get there. And so, from a revenue standpoint, if it becomes more challenging, we'll do something else on the expense side.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q18.pdf
answer,"Hey, Erika, this is John. I'll just reiterate that, that commitment to continually improving our efficiency ratio, we think it's fundamental to our long term performance and to building a consistently performing sustainable bank and that's our intention. So, we are very committed to that.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q18.pdf
question,"Thank you for that. And my follow-up question is again, as the market seems to be pricing in a Fed on hold for some time. How should we think about the margin trajectory for – sorry for 2019 under that scenario? And also, how should we think about the delay in terms of repricing or how long do deposits reprice after the Fed pauses?",Erika Najarian,Analyst,Bank of America Merrill Lynch,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q18.pdf
answer,"Yeah. I think you'll continue to see deposit cost increase, a little lag effect as things go through for the year. We think and – for the quarter, this quarter coming up, we could be relatively stable given everything that's going on. We do have tailwind still from repricing of fixed rate assets, loans and securities, it'll be coming through this year about $12 billion repricing. Those repricings benefit us in the, call it 30 to 50 basis point range maybe a little better today as we continue to see the 10-year move up a bit. So, from a pause standpoint, we still benefit from our – what we believe is our competitive advantage. And that's our very loyal customer deposit base, two-thirds of which is retail. And if you look at our deposit beta and our total funding beta, continues to be below peers. So we think that gives us an opportunity to continue to outperform through 2019 and beyond.","David J.

question,"I need to learn how to use this fancy technology called the telephone. So, I wanted to ask about fees. How do we think about what the right jump-off point is for the fee line? Obviously, you had a lot of moving parts in there with the market volatility, the $22 million that you called out, $3 million of equity investments. Is it as simple as just adding those back in? Because you've kind of been in sort of that $500 million to $510 million run rate in recent quarters. I mean is that – is it – should we just kind of add back those items and is that a reasonable way to think about it looking on a go forward basis?",Saul Martinez,Analyst,UBS Securities LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q18.pdf
answer,"Yeah. Saul, I do you think those are things that adding those back – we're trying to give you the information where you could do that. Our continued growth in NII – NIR will come through if you just look at our core lines, our service charge line continuing to grow along with the account growth that we have. Card and ATM fees is the same way. We continue to grow cards and account. More transactions are moving to that mode of payment. So the interchange should continue to improve there as well. We've made investments in Wealth Management this year in the form of hiring wealth advisors or we will be doing that to help us grow there. Capital markets has been a good growth rate for us, there's volatility in that business from time to time. They finished up well. We've talked earlier about that being a $200 million business. And that's where we finished for the year. So I look at capital markets continuing to add a little bit of growth opportunities. Mortgage is the one that's a little bit more of a challenge. We perform a tad better than others because we're primarily a purchase shop versus a refi shop. Our production was down this quarter, but we are making investments there as well. Those investments are in mortgage loan originators that we'll strategically place in parts of our footprint that we think can give us additional growth there. So the market value adjustments happen from time to time as you know, this fourth quarter was unusually noisy and we don't think recurs at least to that extent going forward.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q18.pdf
question,"Okay. So other than the market value adjustment, it's the – and the equity impact, it's steady as she goes, and seeing growth in your fee lines.",Saul Martinez,Analyst,UBS Securities LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q18.pdf
answer,[indiscernible] (00:31:26). Yeah.,"David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q18.pdf
question,"Yeah. And capital, you've obviously drawn that, the CET1 down to 9.8% you've guided to 9.5%. Is the goal – is the idea still that you get to the 9.5% in 2019? And beyond that, how are you thinking about potentially maybe bringing that down further obviously with the regulatory backdrop NPR out there, is there scope to reduce your target CET1 beyond the 9.5%?",Saul Martinez,Analyst,UBS Securities LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q18.pdf
answer,"We set the 9:5% based on how we view our risk profile, obviously starting with a 4.5% minimum threshold and adding in buffers and then looking at our risk, and that's where the 9.5% is. It didn't have anything to do with the regulatory regime in CCAR. So, hopefully we get a little bit of relief to manage our capital a little more freely than we have been which we would see as a big plus, so that we can optimize our capital and keep our capital at that 9.5% level. Mathematically, given our risk that we have today, we could operate a little less than that, but we are choosing not to do so. We think that's the best thing for us. Give us a little bit of dry powder and be able to take advantage of opportunities to invest that in organic growth and just be prepared should anything happen. But we think that 9.5% is also a capital level that allows us to provide an appropriate risk adjusted return to our shareholders in the form of return on average tangible common equity that they expect. And so, we don't see taking that down.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q18.pdf
question,"Okay. And the buybacks in the first and second quarter obviously a bit lower, but like what's your projection of when you kind of get to that 9.5% now?",Saul Martinez,Analyst,UBS Securities LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q18.pdf
answer,"Yeah, it'll be towards the – it'll be towards the middle of the year. And of course, it's all dependent on loan growth. So we had pretty good loan growth in the fourth quarter that used up a little bit of the capital. And at the rate that we're going at, we could get there towards middle of the year.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q18.pdf

answer,"Good morning, John.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q18.pdf
question,"Good morning. I know you had indicated that the higher charge-offs in the quarter were some of the normalization of consumer and indirect consumer charge-offs. And I wanted to see if you can give a little bit – get a little bit more color on what exact areas within Consumer and indirect are you seeing that, that normalization and what are your expectations in terms of how that – those losses can trend through the year particularly in Consumer?",John Pancari,Analyst,Evercore Group LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q18.pdf
answer,"Yeah. This is Barb Godin. The normalization that we're seeing is really across all products. Residential mortgage is coming off some really low levels, running 4 basis points to 6 basis points of loss, which again is not normal. So that will raise just a little bit. Home equity is doing very well. Home equity will move up just a little bit. Indirect auto has been behaving well for us. So we see that holding pretty steady. Some of the third party relationships that we have, again, they are performing as expected. So where we're seeing the Consumer portfolio overall, we do see things as being pretty straightforward. And our indirect balances have gone up and that's created a little bit again, in terms of a little more marginal loss there. But all-in, credit feels really good where we are right now in this cycle.",Barbara I. Godin,Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q18.pdf
question,"Okay. That's helpful. And then my second one is also on credit. Two parts here. One, your delinquencies, early stage of delinquencies were up 21% this year or this quarter and some of that's Consumer and I get at the – but if commercial was up, so wanted to get some color on what drove that? And then separately, how you're thinking about the loan loss reserve overall here? You bled it by about 2 basis points on a reserve-to-loan ratio this quarter, so, what's your outlook there for the year? Thanks.",John Pancari,Analyst,Evercore Group LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q18.pdf
answer,"Yeah, let me start with the allowance here right, the – it came in at 1.01% which is down just a tad. A lot if that is due to loan growth. We think that allowance will probably hover right in that area. It might go down to 1% but I don't see it going sub 1% on the allowance. Relative to delinquencies, yeah, we did move up just a tad, one of that was a 30-day plus delinquency quite frankly was due to one large C&I credit that by the way repaid us immediately after – we made the payment immediately after the end of the month especially given the holidays etcetera, got caught up in the mail. So, that one's cleared. So, again on the delinquency front, we see those as being generally stable. And again, we look at the consumer book where the delinquencies did go up a tad. Again, that seasonality we see that every fourth quarter. So, nothing there that we're concerned about.",Barbara I. Godin,Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Credit Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q18.pdf
question,"Got it. All right, thanks, Barb.",John Pancari,Analyst,Evercore Group LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q18.pdf
answer,"Good morning, Betsy.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q18.pdf
question,"Hi, good morning. Hi, good morning. Hey, a couple of questions. One, on deposit betas, I know you talked through how you've – it's been low relative to peers and also this quarter. Could you just give us a sense as to whether or not you think any of that was impacted by people moving from maybe market exposures to deposit exposures? Should we expect to see a little bit of a pickup in the first quarter? And if you could give us a sense as to whether or not there was any change in deposit betas on the Corporate versus the Consumer side this past quarter?",Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q18.pdf
answer,"Yeah. I think, Betsy, you should expect that deposit betas continue to move up. We've continued to outperform our cumulative beta at 39%, it's in pretty good shape or 39% for the quarter, I'm sorry, cumulative of 22%. So, I think that we – you're going to see that continue to trickle up a bit. Some of that will be due to mix change as we think about Corporate betas – Corporate betas have moved up to about 81% from 72%. So, continue to see that increase a bit as expected and that's really been baked into our margin guidance all along.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q18.pdf
question,"Okay. Thanks. And then just separately, I know you talked through the 9.5% on the CET1. I guess a couple of questions there. One, does it matter if you don't have to do the CCAR this year? Two, is there a triangulation that you're doing between CET1 and maybe other ratios like TC to TA or other ratios that the rating agencies have out there that you're thinking about that ends up with what looks to me like it might be a little bit on the high end of the range relative to your competitors and relative to the risk in your own book?",Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q18.pdf
answer,"Well, we – everybody has to run their capital ratios based on their own risk profiles or what they perceived to be the risk. We think Common Equity Tier 1 are most expensive form of capital. It behooves us to optimize all of our capital elements but that one in particular given how expensive it is. As we move down closer to that 9.5%, we are solving a portion of our Tier 1 with common equity. So, we will have to backfill the Common Equity piece for Tier 1 with preferred stock. We've had that in our plan. We've talked about that before. That's something that will happen most likely in the middle of the year. We're evaluating how much of that and when we want to put that on. So there are a lot of moving parts there. But you're exactly right. We're going to have to bolster Tier 1, one for regulatory purposes, but also for rating agency purposes. And they know what our capital plan is, and they know what our optimization plan looks like.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q18.pdf
question,"And then on the stress test, if you don't have to do that this year does that – I think it doesn't really matter?",Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q18.pdf
answer,"No. We do our own stress test anyway. We will have to fill out all the forms that are associated with it and maybe – this may be the year of the off cycle. But what we're really looking for and hope we get through the MPR is relieved to manage our capital real time. So we have espoused – as an example we've espoused a 9.5% limit where we want to be on common equity Tier 1. If we could manage capital the way we want to, we would be there right now, we wouldn't have to wait for time. Because when we submit a capital plan, you have to execute dividend changes and share repurchases along the timeline that you provided in your plan which you filed a year before and things change. As things change, we need to be able to maneuver our capital appropriately. So hopefully we'll get that, but we'll have to see.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q18.pdf

question,I was wondering the net interest income outlook for 2019 is it fair to assume that it should grow at a similar pace to the loan growth?,Peter J. Winter,Analyst,"Wedbush Securities, Inc.",regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q18.pdf
answer,"Given, and there are a lot other moving parts but in general – generally speaking that's accurate. As the balance – the balance sheet growth is, depending on what rates do, is going to be the bigger determinant of our growth and NII. We do think – as I mentioned earlier, we have a little bit of a tailwind with just asset reprice, fixed rate assets repricing this year $12 billion between securities and loans if we can pick up 30 basis points to 50 basis points in NII as they come through the pipe. So, – but yeah, I think it's going to be important for us to get appropriate balance sheet growth to continue to grow NII at the pace we want.","David J.

question,"Okay. And then just a big picture question with expenses, you guys over the years have done a very good job holding expenses flat and still investing in the business for a number of years. If we look beyond 2019, is there still levers to pull on the expense side or are you close to exhausting those?",Peter J. Winter,Analyst,"Wedbush Securities, Inc.",regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q18.pdf
answer,"No, I think, Peter this is John, the whole purpose behind our Simplify and Grow initiative was the recognition that at some point we would quit benefiting from rising rates, we would quit benefiting from improving credit, and we would have to be operating more efficiently and effectively. We'd have to be operating in a way that will allow us to grow our business because we were easier to do business with. And so, our commitment to continuous improvement is based upon the belief we can continue to find ways to be more efficient, effective to invest in our business whether it's hiring more bankers, spending money on technology, building some branches in markets. We've got to continue to grow our business through reinvestment, which we largely want to pay for through our effort to be more efficient and effective.","John M.

answer,Gerard.,"David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q18.pdf
question,"John, when you think about the risks to the Regions' earnings stream over the next year or two. Aside from a recession which we all know would bring on the credit provision risk. What do you worry about when you go home at night about your outlook for the company going forward?",Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q18.pdf
answer,"Well, obviously first and foremost, we want to protect and continue to grow our core deposit base. And we think that's really the strength of our franchise. And I think we have demonstrated at least over the last 24 months or so, the power of that deposit franchise much of which wasn't being valued prior to rates beginning to rise. And so – but that would be first and foremost. We've got to continue to grow our businesses. And particularly, those core businesses. So demonstrating [ph] 1.3% or 1.4% (00:45:20) consumer checking account growth, growth in consumer demand deposits, growth in consumer savings, really again core to our business and to what I think makes our franchise valuable and allows us to build that consistently performing and sustainable bank. And then, the other piece is credit. Are we focused on the credit risk appropriate in our business? Are we managing concentrations? Are we building diverse books of business? Do we understand the risks and are we effectively managing those and reacting to emerging risks quickly, and expeditiously, and effectively? Those are the things I think about when I think about what does it mean to be a good banker and how do you build consistently performing and sustainable bank.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q18.pdf
question,"Very good and this question I guess is directed at Barb, over the years, obviously you've had a good understanding of what the regulators are thinking about in terms of risks in the industry's portfolio as well as your own portfolio. We all remember the 2015-2016 time period with energy credits. Can you share with us when you talk to them today, what's their kind of focus in terms of worry on credit? And if you could also tie in, I apologize, if you've already addressed this, your leverage loan exposure and what you guys are doing in that area are as well?",Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q18.pdf
answer,"Yeah. I think the regulators and us we're all in a good place. What's happening as you know in the industry is they're looking as we are looking at normalization and where does that go to, and over what period of time. So there's nothing in particular that they're really focused on. Like us, we're focused on, and you mentioned it, leverage loans. And let me just comment on that in general, I know David already did that our primary definition for leverage loans in the company is consistent with the interagency guidelines from 2013, that's 3 times senior, 4 times total committed debt-to-EBITDA that may or may not be fully secured by margin collateral. Of course there's some differing thresholds based on certain industries such as midstream wireless, towers etcetera, but we don't exclude borrowers from the leverage designation based on credit quality, on borrower ownership for the purpose of the financing. And we make this leverage lending determination at the time of any credit event such as refinancing, renewal acquisition, amendments, all that. And as you know, I guess the difference is every institution has their own policy, quite frankly on how they call a loan leveraged. And so it gets a little difficult in terms of comparability. So, all in as I think about the leverage loan book we feel very good about this book. It's got strong underwriting. We have a dedicated team by the way, Gerard that's focused on these deals. And on top of that, we stress test these loans to ensure that they're going to perform at a downturn economy. So, all-in, yes leverage loans are right now on top of a lot of people's minds but we feel again really good about that book, it's a really strong, good, well-performing book. John M. Turner, Jr. President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp. A Yeah, I would just to add, through our diverse, very diverse and spread across a number of industry groups largely aligned with our specialized industries, bankers, and their expertise. About 27% is sponsor owned and that's down from the mid-30s.

question,If I could sneak just one last question on leverage loans. One of your peers announced earnings this week and pointed out that they had a pickup in their criticized loans. And one of their individual credits was a borrower who went out in the non-bank market and obtained leveraged loans and it alarmed them so they put -they had a criticized loan. What techniques or what monitoring technology do you have or how do you figure out who of your good borrowers who don't have leverage loans with you but could actually go out and do something like that and then you guys have that indirect exposure?,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q18.pdf
answer,"We're actively servicing those credits on a quarterly basis generally sometimes less frequently, sometimes more depending upon the risk in the particular credit relationship. And so as the credit profile or the risk profile changes, because the company takes on additional debt either in the bank environment or non-ban environment, we would pick that up as a risk factor and the consideration is how we think about credit.","John M.

question,"So we hear you loud and clear and I think your investors appreciate your continued discipline in loan underwriting. I think you alluded to in previous calls, potential wholesale consumer strategies to offset some of the GreenSky runoff. And I know you listed the categories, David, during your prepared remarks, but maybe dive a little bit into detail about some of the consumer strategy. And could there be a potential wholesale strategy, and again, I'm not asking if you're buying a depository in terms of obtaining portfolios or accelerating partnerships to deploy your loan-to-deposit ratio of 85%.",Erika Najarian,Analyst,"BofA Securities, Inc.",regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q19.pdf
answer,"Yeah, Erika, good morning. So as we mentioned in the prepared comments, the growth will – we should experience actually will be more on the business services side. On the consumer side, we're going to continue to have our runoff of our indirect auto portfolio that will put pressure on total balances. We have made some shift in terms of our indirect-other consumer. You saw that in the fourth quarter. That'll continue somewhat in the first part of the year, then we kind of get to our concentration limit after first quarter or so. So you shouldn't see that continue to grow at the same pace that you saw in the fourth quarter throughout the year. We are going to continue to grow residential mortgage but we are going to continue to grow our credit card books as well. Those will be the big drivers of consumer, but net-net, total consumer will be relatively stable if you carve out the runoff portfolio. So the growth that we're trying to send the message really is going to come in the – primarily in the C&I area.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q19.pdf
answer,"But Erika, I would say, we are actively observing what's going on in the market, looking for opportunities. We're evaluating different opportunities that may come along. Clearly, we shifted our exposure from the GreenSky relationship to increasing our exposure through [ph] Sofa (00:18:03) that is largely a result of the fact that [ph] Sofa (00:18:06) originating [indiscernible] (00:18:08) directly to consumers versus indirectly, which was the GreenSky model. We like that better. We're learning more about [ph] Sofa (00:18:16) and the portfolio that we Regions Financial Corp.    have and I think you can expect us to continue to explore ways, other ways to grow consumer loans over the next year.","John M.

question,Good morning. You raised your net charge-off guidance slightly for 2020 versus 2019. Just wondering kind of what's driving that? Is it more conservatism or are you seeing some underlying weakness in any certain portfolios? Thanks.,Jennifer Demba,Analyst,"SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.",regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q19.pdf
answer,"Jennifer this is David. So we had 40 to 50 basis points last year. We raised it slightly about 45 to 55 basis points, acknowledging a couple different things. One, if you look at last couple of quarters, we were at 44 to 46. We also see some normalization of credit especially on the consumer side. We also, as Erika just mentioned, some shift in terms of consumer lending into other higher loss categories. We feel good about that because we're getting paid for the risk that we take. But if you're just looking to get the charge-off number in isolation, it will be up perhaps slightly. So we didn't think that. That's really not signaling any broad deterioration in credit, whatsoever.","David J.

question,"Thanks. Good morning. I was wondering if you can follow up the CECL discussion and help us understand how you're starting to think about the day two impacts especially given some of the moving parts of your ins and outs on the consumer portfolio side and you're already high 1.7-ish looks like pro forma reserve-to-loans ratio. Do you think you'll have to meaningfully build as you go forward and how do you start to help us understand that? Thank you. Regions Financial Corp.    David J. Turner, Jr. Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President, Regions Financial Corp. A Yeah, I think the best way – so we need to see what everybody else comes up within CECL. Clearly, the type of lending that you have, your portfolio makes a big difference. Consumer, long-dated assets, duration assets have a much higher CECL reserve to that. As you think about CECL for day two, the first thing you ought to think about is, was a charge-off expectations. And Jennifer just brought that up. From that, then you look at loan growth. We've told you was on an absolute basis, our loans would be flat. On an adjusted basis, they would be up a bit, so not a lot of change there. Then you have to think through the mix, what are you growing versus what's running off. And so we'll give you better clarity on that at a later date. So we don't see a big change in CECL this particular year because we don't currently forecast a change in the economic outlook and that's something that all of us need to be aware of is when you forecast the change in economic outlook, they can cause a little bit of volatility in provisioning. So those are really the key pieces that I think you should consider as you try to model the provision for next year.",Ken Usdin,Analyst,Jefferies LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q19.pdf

question,You guys had a good year on the core fee income growth. It's up about 6%. Do you think mid-single-digit growth is going to be sustainable in 2020? And just if you could talk about some of the businesses where you see some of the better growth?,Peter Winter,Analyst,"Wedbush Securities, Inc.",regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q19.pdf
answer,"Yeah, so Peter, we were very pleased with our growth in the year for non-interest revenue in particular in the fourth quarter. If you take our top three categories, those are really driven by continued growth in customers. So growing customer checking accounts, growing operating accounts, growing customers from the wealth standpoint, those are all critically important to us. We feel good about that. We've hired additional personnel during 2019 that will help us continue to grow customer accounts. As you look at mortgage, mortgage had a really good year this year. It'll be hard to repeat that for all of 2020 but mortgage will be a big contributor to non-interest revenue and we feel good about where we are there. Capital markets had a really strong fourth quarter. We've mentioned to you before that that business has been about a Regions Financial Corp.    $45 million to $55 million revenue per quarter business. We think that, that number is really in the kind of $50 million to $60 million business for us now. So we think relative to 2019, capital markets should have some nice growth. It got off to a pretty slow start in 2019. We think it's going to get off to a nice in 2020 based on the backlog of the business that we see. So, when you add all that up, we have pretty good confidence that we're going to have nice growth in non-interest revenue. And frankly, that is one of the key drivers of why we're committed to and believe we will generate positive operating leverage in a challenging rate environment for 2020.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q19.pdf
question,"Thanks. And just one quick follow-up. You guys have done also a good job on controlling the deposit cost with higher rates and we've seen deposit cost coming down already with the cut in rates. I'm just wondering total deposit cost of 41 basis points, is there much room left to lower deposit cost?",Peter Winter,Analyst,"Wedbush Securities, Inc.",regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q19.pdf
answer,"Our beta for this past quarter was about 28%. That's a little lower than our accumulative beta and our accumulative beta is about 27% this down cycle. That's slightly below what we saw in the uprate cycle. And as a result of that, we think there's – if we stay flat here, there's no movement which we don't expect much movement from the Fed, we would continue to have deposit cost come down some more. It's probably not at the rate that you've seen but I think there's incremental continued benefit there. And again that's part of our margin guidance that we've given you too that we think margin can expand along with the hedging program that we have, that margin would expand a bit in 2020.","David J.

question,"So, look, I know there's some kind of drag to loan growth in, call it, the near-term here and I think the derisking, you guys have been very consistent and have been well received. I guess my question is like if we look kind of more medium-term and think about the type of loan growth that you should have, the type of deposit growth that you should have, considering the market, it's like what's reasonable levels again beyond 2020, just thinking. And the reason I'm asking is I just – I feel like the balance sheet growth has been less than most of us would expect Regions Financial Corp.    given the economies, given your market. But I'm also appreciative of the derisking and call it the focus on the profitability which has helped the [ph] NIM free up the capital (00:26:17). But maybe talk about the other medium- term outlook for those two areas. Thank you.",Matt O'Connor,Analyst,"Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.",regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q19.pdf
answer,"Yeah, so Matt, we have been extremely deliberate in allocating capital to those relationships that give us the appropriate risk-adjusted return. Because at the end of the day, that's what we think really is what our investors want us to do with a capital, not just to grow, but to grow appropriately, to grow with right return. As just an example, this year, we recycled $2 billion worth of credit out of our core banking group that we could have add. We could add an additional $2 billion for the loan growth. It would've been a suboptimal return. These are customers that we seek to sell and offer more of our banking services, so we can have a full relationship with great returns, and we can't get that. When it comes up for renewal, we let it go. And so we're going to stick to that. Now that being said, as you think about loan growth for us in the short and long-term is we should be GDP plus a little bit. Our expectation for GDP this coming year is slightly under 2%. As a matter of fact, it's 1.8% in our estimate. So we have low single-digits loan growth expectations for – on an adjusted basis for 2020. And it's because if we try to push too hard past GDP, we think you make a bad credit decision. So we're going to be credibly disciplined. We realize we need to grow. We're all about that, growing earnings, growing revenues and return. And so it's all about the delicate balance and how we do that appropriately.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q19.pdf
question,"Got it. And just any guess on relative to kind of industry growth or kind of GDP growth, as you think about medium-term kind of loan-to-deposit growth rates?",Matt O'Connor,Analyst,"Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.",regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q19.pdf
answer,"Well, I'd say, Matt, we've said consistently that we, and David reiterated this, if we want to grow with the economy plus a little, recognizing that while the markets we're in are good growth markets, they're also markets that historically have demonstrated a fair amount of volatility. And so it's important to us that we stay disciplined, as David said, focused on appropriate allocation of capital.

answer,"Good morning, Saul.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q19.pdf
question,"Good morning. I guess a follow-up question on CECL. As Ken mentioned, your ACL ratio moves up with your with your day one impact to over 1.7% which seems pretty high given the risk profile of your loan book and the composition of your loan book. The only banks who – very few banks who have given day one impacts are above that level unless they have a much more consumer oriented exposure. And I know a lot of things go into it. I know you have more term loans in your C&I book for example. But I mean I guess how conservative do you think that estimate is it and as I – if I look forward to the day two impact and you think about what you said, David, on mix, it would seem – how do I think about the loss content of what's coming on your books versus what's getting paid off because it would seem given your derisking that that 1.7% reserve ratio could trend lower going forward or is that too aggressive of a comment or an expectation?",Saul Martinez,Analyst,UBS Securities LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q19.pdf
answer,"Well, you asked few questions. Let me see if I can break it down. So the 1.70% relative to others, you really – the mix is hugely important. I suspect when we get to providing more granular disclosures by loan type and break that down so that you will have a better gauge as to what new production would cost and what benefit you might get for runoff of our loan portfolio. So we don't – we tried to get this right. We've tightened up the range quite a bit between $500 million and $530 million. That's again to our 1.1% reserve today which includes a reserve for [ph] unfunded (00:31:23) commitments to 1.70%. So I think what you're going to need some incremental disclosures to help you on a go-forward basis. We'll be providing that to you in a later point. But we think the reserves that we have for CECL is pretty appropriate and we didn't do anything to be overly conservative or otherwise. We just did what we thought the standard called for and we're moving forward. We'll all learn a little bit from each other as we go through the year and we'll be making decisions on how that might affect our business and production and pricing going forward.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q19.pdf
question,"Got it. And I guess just following up like in terms of how should we be thinking about provisions going forward, should we be thinking that a 1.7% lifetime ratio is sort of appropriate, we should be provisioning to maintain that level of reserve ratio going forward?",Saul Martinez,Analyst,UBS Securities LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q19.pdf
answer,"Yeah, I think, for the time being, as I was trying to get to that point earlier is if you think about provisioning for 2020, the first thing you ought to think about is what's your charge-off expectation for us next year. Then what is the loan growth, net loan growth expectation for us next year. We've given you guidance that says our net loans will be flat – we'll grow on an adjusted basis, but we have a runoff of our vehicle portfolio that will be working against balances there. And then your third – and so the third component would be what are you growing, the mix makes a difference and will give you some more granular data later to help you there. And then what's your expectation of the economic outlook from quarter-to-quarter? And that could be – that could change. Now we think the economy is going to be fairly stable this year. That's our going in thought but that can change. And so those are the roughly four pieces that you need to have in terms of projecting CECL provisioning.",Regions Financial,"Corp.    David J.

question,"Regarding your expectation for positive operating leverage in 2020, can you help size up the magnitude or maybe give us just a little bit more color around it regarding the components? And then also why not provide more detailed outlook around 2020? You previously have given full year expense growth and full year revenue targets, what's different about this year that you're not giving that?",John Pancari,Analyst,Evercore Group LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q19.pdf
answer,"Well, let's see if I can help you there. So let's take the big component, so NII which is two-thirds of our revenue would be very hard to grow that this year with the low single-digit loan growth on an adjusted basis that we have given you. And that's just the mere rate play the first half of 2019 rates being up off the December 2018 rate increase would be hard to replicate. And then for the other third of our revenue, NIR, we've given you a little bit of guidance in terms of what you can model. We feel good about that growth. From an expense standpoint, we said we'd be relatively stable from an expense standpoint. And if you add all three of those up, we will generate positive operating leverage. So I think we've been reasonably explicit in terms of what – how we'd get there. So you can play with the numbers from that standpoint.","David J.

question,"Hi, good morning. I'm going to ask the capital question. I know I always do on this call, but I did want to understand how you're thinking about capital utilization, not only in your base case assumption where you've got net loan growth flat in total, but in an environment where things, actually loan growth accelerates a little bit more, maybe you should give us a sense as to, do we just hold with this what I would consider a little bit of excess capital, or is the pipeline of bolt-ons robust enough to use some of this, or do we anticipate a little bit more buyback this year? Thanks.",Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q19.pdf
answer,"Yeah, so it's always a good question on capital. Just to reiterate how we think about utilization of the capital we generated. So first off, we're getting close to our target we laid out, 9.6% Common Equity Tier 1 today, estimated on our current target of 9.5%. As we've mentioned before, that has 50 basis points of the management buffer. Our quantitative calculations set would lead us to believe we need about 9% Common Equity Tier 1. As we think about, first and foremost, our capital there for us to grow appropriately organically in particular, and so we have low single-digit loan growth expectations and you can do some quick math and see we'll use a little bit of capital from that standpoint. Regions Financial Corp.    We've targeted the 35% to 45% of our earnings to go and be paid to our shareholders in the form of the dividend. So you have that piece. We have from time to time done some bolt-on acquisitions. Those use capital. [indiscernible] (00:37:53) but it's certainly something if we see opportunities, John just talked about, we look at different things from time to time. And if we can deploy that capital in a meaningful manner that helps grow our long-term business, we'll do so. And then frankly, the last thing we do is share repurchases. We aren't crazy about doing share repurchases, but we also don't want to continue to have excess capital. So, if we can't deploy it in a meaningful manner through organic loan growth, bolt-on acquisitions, then we'll give that back to the shareholder in the form of share repurchases like we've done this past several years. So I think those are the pieces that you need to have.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q19.pdf
question,Okay. Is there anything on the bolt-on front? I mean you've had a nice pace over the past year or so. And I know you mentioned the fee outlook several times. So is the fee outlook with the current footprint that you have or does the fee outlook – could the fee outlook be enhanced by incremental acquisitions [ph] so you can speak (00:38:58) a little bit to that?,Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q19.pdf
answer,"Yeah, I mean we continue to look at opportunities whether it'd be investments in capital markets capabilities, wealth management, buying more servicing rights, not a great time to do that today but we're still looking. There are other capabilities, potentially that we have some interest in. We look at loan portfolios from time to time and those are things that we'll continue to do as we think about how we invest in the excess capital we have in other parts of our business that will help us grow over time.","John M.

answer,"Hey, Gerard, good morning. You know and you may have heard this earlier, but we are really focused back in on the relationship side of things, Gerard, simply because we believe that when you have a broad and a deep relationship, you become more meaningful to that client and it gives you the ability to weather through whatever storms might be out there when you are meaningful to them, have the opportunity to get in early and really client selectivity on the front side is so important but understanding the complete flow of business that they have, the complete demand that they have with banking services is really where we try to be focused in. I would also say that we look historically at how well companies have gone through the cycles, really strongly lean into the management, their capability, how they perform through the last cycle, and then of course use the standard underwritings that I won't go into the details around that today but those are the high level pieces of how we try to look at the risk that we take on when we go through client selectivity. The only thing I would add to that is that specifically to your question, I think the – what I most consistently hear from our bankers is loan-to-value, so our willingness to provide as much capital as a customer may want tends to be the differentiator. As an example, we may want to loan 60% loan-to-value on a project, then the customer can get 65% or 70% from someone else. So that's a function of [indiscernible] (00:42:18) tends to be the most significant differentiator in today's marketplace.",Ronald G.

answer,"Gerard, this is Barb Godin. I would also add that we stay very, very close to our customers. Our people in the field do an excellent job with that. And we are touching bases with them sometimes on a weekly basis but often monthly, certainly quarterly, and making sure that if there's any early warning signs of any risks that are out there that we're on top of it early. Because as you know if you can get on top of a problem early, you've got a lot more solutions you can give than when you have to wait until there's nothing left to do but to exit the relationship.",Barbara I.

question,"Great. And then just as a follow-up question, obviously, you're one of the so-called extended cycle banks, so you'll be going through a full CCAR this year. David, are you expecting any differences between this year and what you did last year? Last year, obviously, you didn't go through it being an extended cycle bank. Should we expect any kind of differences?",Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,regions,qr,../data/quarterly/earningsTran\regions_4Q19.pdf
answer,"Yeah, Gerard, we kind of – we go through stress tests all the time internally. [ph] There's just this one (00:43:18) that we have to fill out the form and go through the review process with our regulatory supervisors. We are awaiting the instructions for that. We're looking to see if there are any changes. There was an article I think this morning or yesterday, I can't remember [ph] the banker (00:43:34), regarding expectations where some changes Regions Financial Corp.    in CCAR for this year. Things like, if you're in stress, do you have to continue with anticipated share repurchases at the same pace in a stressed environment. I mean that's something we would not do. So we we're hoping that that gets changed in the rules. Or would we continue to grow the portfolio at the same pace that we are now if we're in a stressed environment. So those are two pretty big important things that we're hoping might get changed in the rules. But other than that, understanding what losses are, I mean, if this is a good exercise for the industry for us individually and for our regulatory supervisors, and so we're ready to go and we'll be submitting that plan in first part of April.","David J.

error,"Q So, John, I was going to start off – as we think about the year ahead – I mean there's been a lot of different moving pieces in the environment in 2019 with rates going up and coming back down, concerns of recession and the like, how are you thinking about the year ahead for 2020?",,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_2019_rf_goldman_transcript.pdf
answer,"It's certainly going to be a bit of a challenging year. I would say the interest rate environment poses some challenges, particularly with the flat environment we're in. Good news is our economy's still growing, softer than it was, but still growing. Our customers are optimistic about their businesses. I would say they're more cautious. We've seen some restraint in investment capital spending and so opportunities to grow loans have been impacted a bit, but in general businesses are doing well. The consumer is doing well in our markets. Probably most constraining factor on the economy in the part of the world we're in is job – availability of workforce, plenty of jobs available, but not workers to fill the jobs. And so, all in all, I think the economy is sound and so – and credit continues to while it's, I think slowly normalizing, credit is still pretty benign. And so those conditions are very favorable. We think it will be challenging to grow [ph] NIR (00:02:00), but our hedging strategy protects net interest income to some extent and protects the margin. And we have good momentum, we believe, in growing non-interest revenue, our core businesses are growing, so things like debit card transaction fees, credit cards, service charges on accounts are growing because account – the numbers of accounts are growing across our businesses. Investments in wealth management and capital markets are paying off. So we'll see some growth in non-interest revenue. Expense control is good. We're continuing to make investments in technology and other things, but finding ways to reduce expenses and will going forward. We're committed to generate positive operating leverage. So while we acknowledge that 2020 will be a more challenging year, we're optimistic about the future, feel good about our plans and I think we'll execute them well.","John M.

error,"Q John, you talked about continuing to generate positive operating leverage. Can you maybe just dig in a little bit further what do you see as the key drivers of positive operating leverage in the year ahead?",,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_2019_rf_goldman_transcript.pdf
answer,"Well, on the revenue side, of course, as I mentioned, and we expect to see some growth in NIR, so while revenue growth may be modest, we expect to at least help to mitigate the impact to NII through growth in NIR. And then on the expense side, 50% of our expenses are around people, 20% are FF&E, occupancy expenses and we'll continue to close branches as those opportunities arise, look for ways to impact vendor spend. We'll have reduced occupancy by about 700,000 square feet this year, 700,000 square feet last year. Majority of that is actually office space and not branches. You can imagine, over time, putting a lot of banks together, we've ended up with excess space. We have multiple operations centers. We've recently moved to consolidated data center, which will provide an opportunity for us. So there – we believe that there are multiple ways for us to reduce expenses. And I'll point back to Simplify and Grow, which we kicked off now almost two years ago. We've identified 67 specific revenue generating or expense save initiatives. By the end of this year, we will have completed 23 of those 67. So we would say we're only about a third of the way through the impact that we believe that we will see from either revenue growth or expense saves as a result of that work. And so that gives us, we think, the runway to generate positive operating leverage.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_2019_rf_goldman_transcript.pdf
error,"Q Hey John, you just mentioned you've completed 16 of the 67 initiatives, and as you said there is a plan to finish another 7. As you look ahead, what are some of the major initiatives planned as part of Simplify and Grow for 2020, and how do they contribute to positive operating leverage?",,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_2019_rf_goldman_transcript.pdf
answer,"We're real focused on how do we improve the customer experience through digital and just our overall technology platform. So whether we're working on our mobile banking app or we had teams that are focused on fully digitizing the consumer lending process, we think through process improvement, we both accelerate revenue growth and reduce expenses. And we have a plan to replace our core loan and deposit systems over the next five years. It's a plan our board has recently approved. We think we can do that within the context of our current technology spend, and the manpower that we allocate. We're actually very excited about that because with all the new technology, we think that it will allow us to impact the customer experience in a significant way and again dramatically reduce expenses. And we strive to transform the operating environment, operations of our business to be more exception based. So manual – think about 60% or so of operations processing will be automated over time, and 40% or less exception based, based upon our ability to use technology to intervene. So we think we can really transform the expense base of the company over the next three to five years and transform the way we operate improving the customer experience and driving efficiency down.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_2019_rf_goldman_transcript.pdf
error,"Q Wanted to maybe shift gears and talk a little bit about loan growth. When you go out and talk to corporates with everything that's going on out there, trade, tariffs, the election cycle, what it means – what is sentiment like and are you seeing any meaningful change in your client's appetite to borrow and what does that mean for growth expectations for 2020?",,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_2019_rf_goldman_transcript.pdf
answer,"[ph] Well, to start off, your (00:06:35) business sentiment is – businesses are optimistic but cautious. I think tariffs have had some impact. Volatility in the marketplace, the impending elections all are resulting in businesses being less willing to make significant investment. And then again the availability of labor has some impact on that as well. We've seen inventories come down through the course of the year and so as a result borrowings under lines of credit have also come down. Line utilization has been impacted in general. We've, I think, guided to low single digit loan growth and that's what we would anticipate on an adjusted basis. We do have some runoff portfolios as you know, particularly on the consumer side. We're actively managing our shared national credit book and tall tree risk and so not attempting to grow that. So there are some headwinds to growth, all of which though are grounded in our focus on risk-adjusted returns and getting, one, managing risk and, two, getting appropriate return on the capital that we allocate. And so we're going to be careful. We're going to be cautious. We are long in the economic cycle. That doesn't mean we're headed to a recession but we do think it's time to be careful. And so what I tell our teams is we want to generate good business whether we're in an up or a down cycle. We stay focused on good clients and the right activities. Whether it's good time or bad, we think we ought to be growing our business with the economy and that's our plan.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_2019_rf_goldman_transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah, let me add a little bit to that in that, as we think about the hedging strategy that we set up little over two years ago, most of the derivatives that we put in place are for forward starting to start in January of 2020, to coincide with what we thought was going to be more accommodation coming from the Fed at that time. Of course, they started earlier than we had anticipated. But because we have that program in place, we don't have to push for loan growth to help protect NII. We do know there are some peers who want to push through the challenge from a rate – rate standpoint to have above-average loan growth. We don't have to do that. We set ourselves up so that we would just grow with the economy a little bit and plus a little bit to be able to have the NII profile that we care about.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_2019_rf_goldman_transcript.pdf
unknown,"Q John, I wanted to spend a minute talking about technology. You talked about replacing your core loan and deposit system over the next years. I believe you guys are spending somewhere in the low to mid-600s on technology on an annual basis. So, I guess, a couple of questions, just one, where are the major investments being made across the company right now and when you think about scale relative to some of the larger institutions who are 4 spending a lot more, where do you think you're outperforming those banks on the tech side and where do you think you need to do more?",error,error,error,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_2019_rf_goldman_transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah. We will spend $625 million on technology this year and likely a similar amount next year. 48% of that will be to maintain our core operating platform and systems, 10% will be dedicated to cybersecurity and about 42% to new capabilities, new products, innovation. Great focus on data and analytics. If I look at where we probably are a bit deficient relative to our larger peers it would be in the use of data and analytics. Many of those banks have large card portfolios. They've been using data for a long time and as data and analytics have become more available, they've accelerated the use of that and how they market to customers. And so if there's an area that we are investing fairly heavily in, it is in talent around data. We've hired a Chief Data Officer now about 15 months ago. He came out of telecommunications and has a deep background there and also in private equity related data type uses and we're excited about the work that he is doing. So we think that'll be important to us. Artificial intelligence, and we've talked about before the use of AI in our call center, in our branches for our next best offer platform as two examples. We have, we think, opportunities to use AI to automate lots of our operational practices, whether it'd be BSA/AML and some of our loan processing to again transform the operations of the bank and to drive more processing to automation versus manual intervention and those are all things that we're spending a lot of time on in addition to impacting the customer experience, so mobile, consumer lending digitization, just online generally are all major investment platforms for us.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_2019_rf_goldman_transcript.pdf
error,"Q David, you talked a little bit about the hedging strategy that Deron and his team put in place. I guess can you – one, can you remind everyone just what was done and what – given that the rate environment looks I'd say more stable at this point in time, what do you think this could mean for the net interest margin for the bank over time?",,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_2019_rf_goldman_transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah. I'll start and let Deron add to that. So, as I mentioned, a couple of years ago we were anticipating a slowing economy. To go back to our Investor Day, we had GDP expectations below 2%. This year, we think it's going to be 1.8%. I think can go down to 1.6% and then just above 1% after that. With that slowing economy, we had expected that the Fed was going to become more accommodative and reduce rates. And so we wanted to put some protection in because our deposit base, which is our competitive advantage, our deposit costs were lower than our peers and have been, and so to protect the margin, the reduction in deposit cost for us was going to be lower than it was for peers, so we needed to cover the margin protection through the use of derivatives. So, primarily interest rate swaps [indiscernible] (00:12:46) fixed swaps, some interest rate floors, those were set up before starting, as I said, for the most part January of 2020. As a result of that, we think, we're going to see a little bit of a dip in the margin in the fourth quarter because we didn't have the hedging profile in place for 2019. But what that means for next year when those do kick in that we can recover a little bit in the margin and be in that lower [ph] 3.40s (00:13:14) we think for 2020. So you actually see the margin improve a bit when we get to the first quarter.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_2019_rf_goldman_transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah. So, obviously, we've had a nice tailwind as rates have been rising over the last couple years. Obviously that goes away. Our goal with the program was just to reduce variability in net interest income and not have rates be a big driver one way or the other in terms of the margin and net interest income. And I think we've done a pretty good job of that. We still have some exposure to the shape of the curve as we – as we engage in new business activities over the course of the year. We've been more recently trying to hedge some of that as well. I think we're in the 40% to 50% hedged in relation to our exposure to the long end of the curve. We still have some modest exposure. A steeper curve is better for us but I think the real story is that rates will be roughly a non-story for us. What is rolling off the balance sheet, what's maturing, what's amortizing and what's coming back on in the form of a new business, at current rates, is roughly a push and so neutralized our exposure to the short end. Clearly a steeper curve is better for us but at current rate, is not a big driver going forward. So really the – the outlook for rate is less of a driver for us in growth in NII and the margin will be more driven by the business mix and how we grow the balance sheet.",M. Deron Smithy,Executive Vice President & Treasurer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_2019_rf_goldman_transcript.pdf
answer,"To your last part, [indiscernible] (00:14:48) for a while from a rate standpoint. I still think you'll see deposit costs continuing to trickle down a bit over the next couple of quarters. Clearly with even a rate reduction later in the year, if that were to happen, gives us an opportunity to continue to bring our deposit costs down without sacrificing really NII given our hedge profile. So – but if it doesn't happen and we do you stay here for an extended period of time, we're okay with that. We just like [indiscernible] (00:15:16) to stay as close to 2% as we can get. We're in the 1.8% range, so little steepness would be helpful.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive Vice President,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_2019_rf_goldman_transcript.pdf
error,"Q Maybe just a follow-up on one of those comments that you made David that you guys were actually pretty successful in terms of the ability to bring down deposit costs in the third quarter and I think the expectation is for that to happen further. Can you maybe just talk about what you're seeing and then just as a follow-up to the comment you made that you'd expect deposit costs to continue to come down, anything differential between consumer relative to commercial in terms of your ability to bring down costs?",,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_2019_rf_goldman_transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah, I think we've done a good job. I think our teams have really done a good job of managing deposit cost on the consumer side. In particular, we have a whole committee that meets to ensure that we have proper rates established for all of our products, so that we're competitive in the marketplace but reactive to reality which is the fact that rates were coming down. On the business side, that's lagged a bit. We're going to undo the beta essentially that we experienced when rates were going up, so that'll take some time on the business service side, little slower. I think you'll see more impact coming from that – more contribution of the reduction in the deposit cost coming from business than you will on the consumer side. And I think piece of that was tying some of those rates that were – became index, so as Fed funds came down those would trigger rate reductions. And then some was just negotiated. So larger commercial customers are just one-on-one negotiation to reflect the economic reality. I think you add all that up and rates, deposit cost will trickle down over the next couple of months without any further change.","David J.

error,"Q John, you mentioned that and – net interest income is going to be hard to grow [ph] in the year of (00:17:09) hedges given the fact that the margin was higher in the beginning of the year and you were not trying to push too hard on growth, but if you think about it, the other 35% of revenues, is fee income...",,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_2019_rf_goldman_transcript.pdf

So as we're sitting here today, where do you see the biggest opportunities to drive growth across fee income for the bank?",,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_2019_rf_goldman_transcript.pdf
answer,"So, as I said, we're – because we're growing core checking accounts, we'll continue to see modest growth in just general service charges which is always positive. We're going to make investments in wealth management and capital markets, both places where we think we have real opportunity, both given our business mix and our footprint and customer base. And mortgage is a business we like. We have a low-cost mortgage servicing platform. We think we do a good job with it. We've acquired mortgage servicing rights historically. Not a great time to do that today, but we'll stay focused there. We're hiring mortgage loan officers because in the markets that we serve, there is a lot of in- migration and so, housing activity, and we think that's a starter for building relationships with customers. So, those are all places we'll make investments and expect to see nice fee income growth in the future.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_2019_rf_goldman_transcript.pdf
answer,"I think one of the things on capital markets that we – headwind we had this year was really the CVA adjustment we had as rates came down. Our derivative book was marked. And those customers continue to pay, we should get our recovery in time there. But some of that also is our M&A business, which has a tendency to be a little more volatile. There are some deals that were pushed into 2020 from 2019. And so that's a – we've talked about that business being a $200 million business per year for us.

unknown,"Q Let us shift gears for a minute and talk about expenses. You mentioned before that you're looking to continue to hold the line on costs. I made a joke to you at dinner last night, feels like the entire time I've been covering the company, you've been holding costs flat. So, I guess, at this point, after so many years of cutting and repurposing, where are the areas that you're finding opportunity to cut costs or is it more just, as you said before, the bank is 7 going through such a transformation that it's process improvement and it's all these different things that are driving it? Can you maybe talk about where you're finding incremental opportunities now to drive costs out?",error,error,error,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_2019_rf_goldman_transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah. I think a couple places. I mean, one is, we are continuing to consolidate our branch footprint and exiting businesses and portfolios that aren't generating appropriate returns, and that's a discipline we've developed and a good exercise we go through that helps impact cost to be sure. Additionally, as I mentioned, we've got a significant occupancy expense associated with facilities in many cases that we inherited through acquisitions from years ago and as we exit those things, we're able to reduce cost and we'll keep working on that. Oftentimes, you identify an opportunity, but it's harder to make it actionable quickly. And so we still have a number of opportunities. I talked about our Simplify and Grow initiative which we think is about a third complete. And so there are a lot of process improvement and/or revenue generating opportunities that will have an impact on both revenue and expense as your question is about expenses. But, I think that'll, through process improvement, just overall transformation, gives us a real chance to reduce numbers. So we talked last night about the contact center as an example where we're using artificial intelligence to intercept calls that resulted in our being able to reallocate or reduce 55 FTE as an example and we are just getting started there. So, those are the kinds of things we'll be doing in the future.","John M.

answer,"Yeah. As I said earlier, I think there's – we have a tremendous opportunity and the thing that we're excited about – oftentimes people talk about replacing their core systems. It's a daunting task and I'm not naïve enough to think that it won't be very challenging but at this stage and the development of technology, we think it gives us an opportunity to embrace the change, to embrace the transformation with technology developing as it is to change processes and embed those into new technology in a way that allows us to transform the back office, to improve the overall customer and banker experience, to make our processes more seamless, more frictionless and to really separate us as a regional bank that's using technology in a way that many of our peers will not do.","John M.

error,Q I wanted to switch gears and talk a little bit about capital. Can you just startup maybe by reminding us what are the priorities?,,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_2019_rf_goldman_transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah. So, from our standpoint, we want to optimize our capital, common equity Tier 1 being the key measure at 9.5%. Just to remind everybody mathematically, the amount of capital we need to have based on the risk profile, as we measure it, and leverage CCAR is about 9%. So we've added 50 basis points of management cushion if you will to allow us to take advantage of opportunities, especially in the downturn should those opportunities arise. That would be making investments in loans that others might not be able to make because they have to conserve their capital. So we have that excess we're continuing to carry. What's important to us first and foremost to pay an appropriate – we think is an appropriate dividend. We've talked about 35% to 45% of our earnings being paid out in the form of the dividend. Second is we want to use our capital to grow, grow organically in particular. So we'll use a piece of that and we're going into a slowing economy, so there's only so much capital will be absorbed by that. We also look for non-bank acquisitions, things that can bolster our product set or service set to continue to make offerings at our customers' desire, so we use a little bit of capital. Highland Associates would be an example of that. And then to keep our capital optimized at that 9.5% as the rest of that goes into share repurchases. So I think that order is important to us. We don't like to buy our stock back. But we also need to optimize capital and that's what we'll do if we can't put that to better use within the company. We have talked about bringing up capital from things that don't give us the appropriate return on our capital. We've gone through all of our businesses and continue to go through businesses and products to make sure that's the case. So it's all about optimization.","David J.

answer,"Yeah, so, John's asked all of us, including the heads of our businesses, to be on the lookout for things that we may want to acquire again to help round out our product offering to our customers. So constantly looking at from a customer's vantage point, what do they need that we can provide? If we don't have it, can we acquire it? And so I'd say every one of the businesses are out there looking. You saw the Highland Associates in wealth management. You'll see more servicing rights in consumer. You'll see different product offerings in commercial that we're looking at and other things in consumer. So there's no one particular thing.

I wouldn't point necessarily to that being so much a function of disruption. It is as it is just continually investing in the markets and focusing on growing and developing relationships. Q So recently when David spoke, the theme of M&A came out and I think the market would like to hear from you, John, in terms of your views on M&A, whether you're interested in doing things like low or no premium deals and just generally how do you think about traditional bank M&A at this point of cycle?","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_2019_rf_goldman_transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah. Our views on bank M&A really haven't changed. Historically, the economics have not necessarily favored Regions. Some of the low premium, no premium deals certainly change a bit of our perspective about that. But we still believe that we have a very solid plan. And if we execute our plan, that we can deliver financial results that will be very meaningful to our shareholders. And if we do that, we believe then we will benefit. And as a result, our currency will be stronger and if we end up in an economic downturn or we have some other opportunity, we'll be positioned to potentially take advantage of that. But our focus needs to be on executing our plan, getting better at what we do, densifying our business and markets that we have a current presence in, continuing to build our business. We think there's a tremendous opportunity to get better just through better execution and continuous improvement and that's – that's really our focus. Non-banking M&A has been important to us. It will continue to be important to us. David talked about some of the things that we like to do and we're actively looking at different opportunities across segments and I think that's where our primary focus will be.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_2019_rf_goldman_transcript.pdf
error,"Q I guess just given your focus on densifying markets, the growth environment is slow, as I say you guys have been cutting costs for a long time, if the right, whether it's merger, equal or low premium acquisition came across, is it something that you would consider?",,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_2019_rf_goldman_transcript.pdf
answer,"We have to always be open minded. I mean that's – we have that obligation, right? And we talk to our board about that. When you think about – ask about our aspirations, our intention, we're in 15 states today. We don't believe we need to expand our footprint. We need to get more dense in the markets that we're currently in. And so we have to be open to all the things that potentially come along. We consistently think about acquisition targets. That's part of what we should be doing, part of what our board challenges to do, but I would tell you the list is fairly short. M&A is challenging. Got to have a right cultural fit, you got to have a right business fit, you need to know what you're acquiring and what you expect to accomplish and so we want to be very disciplined around acquisitions and use of capital, whether it's allocating capital to a business, whether it's buying a non-bank or entering into a non-bank transaction, entering a bank transaction, we've got to be really thoughtful about how we use our capital in every aspect, and we'll continue to do that.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_2019_rf_goldman_transcript.pdf
unknown,"Q 10 David, in terms of CECL, you noted $500 million to $600 million Day 1 increase, which is about 40 basis points of capital. Now that we've all kind of worked through the upfront hit, can you maybe just talk about the Day 2 impact particularly for growing on the consumer side? Does this change the way how you approach growth?",error,error,error,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_2019_rf_goldman_transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah. So, I think everybody's starting to warm up to the fact that CECL is pretty punitive to assets that have a lot of duration that tends to manifest itself on the consumer side. But I think the industry is going to be learning a little bit this year in terms of what that might mean strategically to us – to us all. I think, if you just take mortgage as an asset class, we're going to be in the mortgage business and does it cause us to think about pricing or does it cause us to think about what we're going to retain on the balance sheet versus sell, we will. So, we have a lot. Obviously, Regions' financial won't change the pricing in the market for mortgages. So the whole industry has to gravitate around what that might mean. So this year will be a learning year. We have not changed our focus on continuing to grow and serve our customers and provide all the products and services we need. But I do think it's going to be interesting to see what Day 2 and the impacts of that really will mean. We're going to be going into an environment that is still fairly strong economically. It's not a recession, it's just a slowing growth, but still growing. And so I don't think the delta between CECL and the incurred loss model we have today is going to be dramatic. It gets exacerbated when you forecast a downturn and that will be a bigger challenge for us all.","David J.

error,"Q And that's a question on credit, and then if there is a question from the audience, we could open up. So, John, you referenced all the way that you are seeing slow normalization inside the portfolio. We've seen some increases in criticized assets. I guess as you look across the portfolio, are there any pockets of concern emerging? And secondly are you seeing anything on the consumer side [indiscernible] (00:31:53)?",,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_2019_rf_goldman_transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah, not really anything on the consumer side that I would point to. On the business side, I think we have called out fast casual restaurant as being an area of some stress now for probably a year-and-a-half to two years. The energy sector feeling some stress as there's really an absence of capital coming back into that sector. And then manufacturing has been slowing since the spring. And as we've seen a little migration in the criticized and classified [ph] rumor (00:32:25), our levels of criticized and classified are at historically low levels, but as we've seen some migration in, it's largely been from energy related or manufacturing related credits primarily.","John M.

error,"Q Any questions from the audience? [indiscernible] (00:32:48) ask one more. So, at the Investor Day you laid out a handful of targets and then the rate environment collapsed against you. Can you maybe just talk about – while obviously delivering on some of these targets is going to be challenging over the three-year period, can you maybe just talk about what some of the levers that you have to try to at least approach these targets?",,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_2019_rf_goldman_transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah. That February meeting seems like years ago actually and maybe dog years anyway. I think we've just got to focus on our core business. And, as I said earlier, continuing to grow the business. We're trying to build a franchise that's consistently performing, that's sustainable, that's resilient and that means [indiscernible] (00:33:30) good times and bad, focusing on the right clients and right activities. And I think our teams are doing that. We're making investments in markets we believe we can grow in, while protecting and what we think is the real value of our franchise and that's our very loyal low cost deposit base in our core markets, where by the way, we typically would have – about 70% of our deposits are in markets where we have top five market share. Coincidentally, 70% of our deposits are in markets where we don't have any meaningful money center bank competition. 86% of our deposits are in seven Southeastern states, many of which are – several of which are growing significantly, some of which are growing modestly, but are very stable and consistently performing. So it's that balance of core markets and growth markets that we think presents a lot of opportunity. And, again, we're excited about our technology investment and the opportunity we see ahead to transform the company and be a digitally enabled regional bank. I still think the business is going to be about people, it's going to be about talent, it's going to be about bankers [indiscernible] (00:34:42) business solutions to customers and so we're excited about the bankers we're able to recruit to our team and believe we can deliver really nice results.","John M.

error,"Q Thank you, David. And similar to other in-conversations, if there are questions from the audience, please raise your hand. Maybe following up on your last comment, David, about predictable and sustainable profitability, what levels do you think you can achieve to make that sustainable, whether it's a return on equity number or a return on asset number? How do you look at that? How do you frame it?",,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_BAAB-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Yes. So, several things. We've improved. We've really focused on risk-adjusted returns in our businesses. That's really been a cultural change. We're not interested in nominal growth of revenue, nominal growth of the balance sheet, nominal growth of net income. It's about the proper growth, the right risk-adjusted return so that we can get our return on tangible common equity up. We'll be at approximately 16% this year. We think there's another point or two left over time. Maybe if things remain benign for an extended period time, maybe you push past that, but it's not about top ticking margin and top ticking revenue in return. It's about being able to maintain an appropriate return for the kind of bank that we're building, such that when things turn, and they will, that we weather that storm and that we're prepared and we anticipate the storm versus sitting on the beach and waiting for the tsunami wave to overrun you. We're going to listen for the earthquake that creates the wave and deal with that more timely. So, that's what's sustainable and predictable is for us, and I think having an appropriate return to the shareholders is what's most important.","David J.

answer,"I'll let John and Amala talk about this. So, we haven't disclosed our technology budget. But, John, why don't you talk about what we are doing.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_BAAB-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Let me talk a bit about what we're doing. This is IBM Watson product we're using. We started that process about a year and a half ago. We started in really two places in the bank. We started in our risk management area with BSA/AML, and we also started in the contact center. And what we're trying to do with AI in the contact center really is around how do we enable our reps to better serve our customers and how do we get a better experience for our customers. So, two things we're doing in the contact center. First, one example would be customer calls in an online banking or mobile question, they'll actually get Reggie which is a digital assistant. And Reggie will actually handle the call and never pass that person off to an agent. The second thing we're doing is our reps, when they're listening to a customer and the customer is asking a question, they can google IBM Watson for the answer to the [ph] question's answering (18:11). So, I think what we're trying to do is really make this a digital assistant for our reps and really enable them to have consistency, better training times. And also, just call volume itself, Reggie has handled about 60 – equivalent about 60 people of calls. On the ROSIE side, what we're doing with ROSIE, it's more of a predictive AI system. So, what ROSIE does is for every customer we have, so, you walk in any one of our 1,455 branches, that branch associate knows that customer and has a unique personalized offer, next best action for that customer in every branch. If you call a contact center, it's the same thing. You'll get a unique offer based on your background, based on your profile and back on your data. We're trying to integrate this as well into online and mobile. We're not quite there yet. We've started in the branch and contact center, and we will be going to the online and mobile space as well.",John B. Owen,Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_BAAB-Transcript.pdf
error,"Q Maybe, John, we could talk about the Simplify & Grow. You've obviously made progress here. Can you share with us, was that the low-hanging fruit, the first months of success? And maybe some detail on the initiatives that now that you see coming down the pike.",,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_BAAB-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah, just a little bit of background on Simplify & Grow. Really as David said earlier, it's focused on three things: how do we make banking easier for our customers and our associates, how do we accelerate revenue, and how do we be more efficient and effective. So we've got about 45 initiatives identified, the results I would tell you for first year, we've reduced head count by about 9% to 10%. We've also, our second largest expense at the bank is occupancy expense. We've taken about 750,000 square feet out of the system and we expect to do similar results like that next year as well. So to your comment on the low-hanging fruit, I think some of the low-hanging fruit's out of the way, the structure changes we made. The 45 initiatives that we have right now, some of the larger ones were around how do we take the complete consumer lending experience and go digital and David talked about what we've done with mortgage. There's other examples where we've gone through our branch network and we've taken out about 400,000 hours of work out of the branch network and we've either stopped that work, centralized that work and it's allowed us to reduce bankers which is a big part of that save on head count.",John B. Owen,Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_BAAB-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah. Let me add to that. So low-hanging fruit – those of you that have been following us know we had a $300 million expense program at one time. We upped that another $100 million and then we did Simplify & Grow. All of that has really been trying to become far more efficient. The first two were about efficiency. Simplify & Grow is about efficiency and effectiveness at revenue growth. And there was a lot of change that was pushed through the organization, and John his team and others have done a great job of dealing with the change. But the point is, these 45 initiatives that we have that are open right now, we need to get through those and we need more initiatives. We have to get better because our efficiency ratio, we're proud of the fact that we've got another 60%, 59.7%. That's not good enough for us. We think we need to be in the mid-50s right now. We get there, then we'll put another target on. So it's not about just this destination, it's about the process and the journey that we go through just to get better every day as we seek to improve returns for our shareholders.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_BAAB-Transcript.pdf
answer,"And the biggest focus I would tell you really is around how do we make banking an easier part of this. So, we have agile teams really across the bank working on everything from how do we make the checking account opening process better both at digital and in person. How do we go through and make the mortgage process faster in person. How do we make all consumer loan categories easier. Our commercial credit, David mentioned a 70% reduction in the time it takes to give the customer a yes or a no on a commercial loan. That really was about reengineering the process, some level of automation and really just putting an attention and focus on it with agile teams.",John B.

error,Q [ph] John (22:22).,,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_BAAB-Transcript.pdf
error,Q [indiscernible] (22:23-22:46),,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_BAAB-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Okay. So, the question was our beta has outperformed our peers, at what point do we deal with that and what's the impact. And then if we take our asset sensitivity off, when do we do it and how we do it. That was close enough, wasn't it, [ph] John (23:05)? Okay. So, from a beta standpoint – [ph] John (23:08) has asked a great question. We can't continue to have outperformance. So, we're about 10 points different than peer median on beta right now. Call it 25% for peer median, we're at 15%. We don't see that going to 15% and 20% and 25%. We think we have to be close enough, otherwise we run the risk of deposit flows going the wrong way. I think the expectation is we still have this beta assumption that we would be in the 55% to 60% through the cycle. So, we're going to give – have to start passing through more of the next increases through – which, by the way, we have December and two baked in next year, one in kind of the middle of the year, the other one in the back end. And we think our beta for those changes are going to have to be fairly consistent with peers. So, net-net, we still think, when you get to the end of the day, we outperform, but we're not going to continue to have that expansion. One of the most important things we look at right now is our asset sensitivity. You can see that has come down just a bit, and up [ph] 100 bps (24:17) today. It's about $100 million for us, call it 3%, and that's coming down. It's coming down as we anticipate what we think rates will do and we compare that anticipation with what the market is saying. And so, if you believe 3% to 3.50% Fed funds is kind of neutral, which I know there's debate as to what that means, but let's for argument's sake say that's neutral, then we think that we need to be prepared to take our sensitivity down to zero to maybe becoming liability sensitive as the economy runs more risk after these increases are rolling over. And so, it's a timing issue. For us, if we look what we did last time in the up-rate cycle is we ran with sensitivity and had over a 4% margin, and that was great while we were experiencing it. But when the economy turned, it was too late to change that sensitivity and so we got crushed on margin and we had got crushed on credit. Those are the two things we have to do much better on. So, if you think about – and those of you that are listening and can't see me, if you think about our deposit cost being lower than our peers, when rates roll over, peers will have deposit repricing to help protect their margin and such. We have to use derivatives to help do that. You can't wait till 11th hour to go put your derivative on. It's too expensive. So, you have to leg in as you go. You saw us add about $2 billion worth of floors this past quarter. And so we spend our time, John and ALCO, talking about timing. And it's really looking at rates, looking at the economy, kind of thinking what the Fed may do over the long haul. So, sorry, that's a long answer to a short question.","David J.

error,"Q Yes, [ph] Mike (26:10)?",,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_BAAB-Transcript.pdf
error,"Q What is your [ph] best targets (26:12) on why you can compete with the largest banks on scale? Yesterday, or last night, Bank of America highlighted that [indiscernible] (26:20) it's more than a lot of banks your size, total expenses. Yesterday morning we heard from JPMorgan. They've spent $5 million this year on simply technology investment. How do you compete against that?",,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_BAAB-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah. So, the question is, how do we think about scale in particular related to technology budget and the fact that the money center banks can spend a lot more money than Regions Financial can spend. And I'll start and then let John kind of add to it. So, clearly we can't spend anywhere close to what they can. They have more infrastructure that they have to take care of. They're global. They have more countries they have to deal with. We are a little more nimble in terms of looking at what new technologies may be out there that our customers want and need and desire. And so we're constantly asking the question, what's out there? Because what people adopt from a technology that our customers really want, well, we can adopt that fairly quickly. We don't have to be first. So, we aren't going to try to outspend the money center guys. We'll say that 70% of our markets do not have – we do not have a money center presence in 70% of our markets. We are the money center bank in our markets. So we control and dominate those markets and we believe it's customer service that's the driver. If you can make sure you take care of your customers, then you're going to be in pretty good shape. John, you want to add to that?","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_BAAB-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah, what I'd add to that, really the lens we look at it versus spend is what are our customers telling us. And so we use J.D. Power and Gallup to go really look at our channels. We get a quarterly report, and what we find, whether it's our mobile channel or online or branches, we consistently, through J.D. Power, in the top quartile of performance in mobile and online banking. So as long as our customers are saying, hey, I think your mobile and online capabilities are meeting our needs, and we're growing our customer base, which we are, and our digital adoption is continuing to grow – we grew logins last year almost 40% in mobile banking. We grew remote deposit capture almost 70% last year in mobile banking. So we're seeing good growth. But again, I look at J.D. Power and Gallup and take that voice to the customer and go, what we're delivering is meeting our customers' needs. The other thing I would tell you is, they're going to always spend more than we are because of a couple of things. I've got 1,455 branches that I've got to go out on a regular basis and upgrade hardware and software and routers. Those guys have 6,000 or 7,000, so they're going to always spend more than I am in technology. When I go make a system change, I have one branch platform, I have one platform. So when I have to make a change in that platform, I do it one time, I test it one time and I implement it one time. Some of these guys have five, six, seven branch platforms. They'll have to make that change six or seven or eight times. So, they are going to spend more than us, but I don't think that necessarily equates into a better mobile experience.",John B. Owen,Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_BAAB-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah. I'd just add one more point to that. Even the simplicity of our architecture, if you look at Bank of America's architecture, the complexity adds in a lot of cost for them. Our reliance on automation or machine learning and predictive analytics or even simplicity of architecture is also enabling us to do things faster.

answer,"Yeah. So, the question was, what do we really think opportunities are to modify the CECL standard that's due to be implemented January of 2020. All of us have spent a lot of time, money and effort to understand the impact of CECL. We've learned a lot through our modeling techniques. And we were concerned about the impacts on our business related to long-dated lending mortgages would be a prime example. So, today, the new standards that will go in will tell you you need to reserve life loan losses on that mortgage and put that through the provision day one. So, you can see in times of trouble that – and of course interest income's earned over time, you can see you won't make much money on a mortgage loan for some period of time. And when you go into an environment that's troubled, you're going to have less willingness to want to be the financial intermediary that we're supposed to be to try to help get the economy out of the ditch. And so, we were concerned about what people might do. As a result, about 21 of us signed a letter, it went a couple of days ago to the FASB, went to the regulators, went to the SEC to try and provide a slight modification to the standard which would say we're good with life of loan losses because investors want to know especially in troubled times, am I going to have a capital hole I have to fill and dilute you, and that's what you're really asking. So, we're okay with life of loan losses but split the debit into two places, take one year of losses through P&L to match up with the revenue stream that's coming in that year, and take the rest through OCI so that way you see the capital impacts for life of loan losses. Of course, banks less than $250 billion exclude OCI from capital, so that fixed a second issue that we were concerned about which was a double dip in the capital regime. So we've talked to Congress. We've talked to the FASB and SEC regulators. We are hopeful that they strongly consider the proposal. We think it's fair and balanced. There's an awful lot of work that has to go on this, and smaller institutions really are going to have a tougher time because they don't have the modeling capabilities that we all developed, and especially those of us that are CCAR banks. So, what's the probability? I don't know. We'll have to see. They just got the letter two days ago. So, they'll go through their vetting process and we'll see.","David J.

error,"Q Yes, [ph] Marty (32:58).",,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_BAAB-Transcript.pdf
error,"Q So, David, on that topic, when you're doing life of loan losses, why are we also adding in an economic flavor? In other words, shouldn't we consider that over the life of the loan there's going to be a downturn at some point? So, the fact that we're using or already considering or incorporating that kind of loss, period. So why is it that all of a sudden we're hearing a lot more about [ph] net-netted syndicators explained (33:23) as bad or good and you're going to adjust your provisioning? It just seems like that element of it is going to add a lot of more volatility than what it was intended to do at the beginning.",,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_BAAB-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah. So, the standard requires you to look at life of loan which does have – you're leveraging your history and what you know about the economy. But none of us can forecast a downturn nor the severity of a downturn. And it's that delta of what I think about the economy and what my peers think about the economy that differ that we're afraid is going to create undue volatility and a lack of comparability from bank to bank. And as analysts and investors, that's really a problem. So, yes, we will start day one with higher reserves, right, because the implementation of this will be you'll adjust life of loan losses on day one, push that through equity. So, you have a higher allowance. But then factors change as life goes on. You have new production that you have to deal with as well. It's the new production that concerns me even more because I think that in times of – if we're in benign times right now, CECL is not that big a deal. It's incrementally higher provisioning. But you get into a troubled time when you finally recognize that tsunami wave coming, and you have a massive change which creates the pro-cyclicality that we're trying to at least minimize.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_BAAB-Transcript.pdf
error,"Q Yes, [ph] Bill (34:54).",,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_BAAB-Transcript.pdf
error,"Q Just update on loan growth both the front-end originations and also the payoffs and pay-downs. Is it worsening? Is it getting any better? Is it stable? And also on net interest margin, investment security portfolio yields, what's the outlook for that?",,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_BAAB-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Okay. So, the first was on loan growth and what our expectations were there. Of course, we've had low single digit loan expectations for the year. We said that would be – that would come in the back half of the year. The first half was really leveraging tax savings, whether it be repatriation or extra cash for not having to pay ES payments. Our production was good in the first half of the year, we've told you that, but it didn't manifest itself in outstandings until the third quarter. So, we had pretty nice growth in the third quarter. It wasn't great growth, but it was fairly solid. It was diversified geographically and within products, primarily in the C&I book. We expect that to continue. We have not seen that run off to the capital markets like we did last year about this time. Doesn't mean it can't happen, we just haven't seen evidence of that. So, we have expectations we'll meet our loan growth target that we laid out. Your second question was on the securities book, and let me answer a slightly different question, [ph] Bill (36:17), and see if this gets it. So, our fixed-rate securities and loans is about $14 billion that will come through the next 12 months that will be reinvested in whatever the rate is at that time. Our best estimate is about a point to a little over a point pickup in terms of income because of the – just a higher rate environment, which means we have a pretty good tailwind coming. It doesn't require rates to go up at all, it's just rates are already higher than where these fixed-rate assets were. So, that's going to be beneficial to us to continue to grow net interest income and the resulting margin.","David J.

error,"Q Just one on the artificial intelligence. We've heard a lot about that. And you mentioned IBM Watson. When you land that onto a consumer, what is it looking to learn about me or whoever? I mean, how far does it reach into one place to help you make a better prediction of what that person [indiscernible] (37:21)?",,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_BAAB-Transcript.pdf
answer,Yeah.,John B. Owen,Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_BAAB-Transcript.pdf
answer,"So repeat that, yeah.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_BAAB-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah. The question was around our AI deployment, how far does that go as far as data and getting to know that unique customer. I'll give you two perspectives. On the one we use on the consumer side which really helps decide the next best action, we're really primarily looking at all of your internal data with the bank. So, what your habits are, what your behaviors are, what products you already have, your income levels, your life stage, children's ages, [ph] is anyone (37:49) preparing for college. So, it's really taking all the data and preferences we know about you with some external data and making a next best recommendation based on that profile. So, again, that's been very helpful for us. We've seen we've driven quite a bit of incremental revenue this year with that. And as it gets smarter, again, it makes better offers and more timely offers. On the contact center aside, the contact center side really is more looking for how do we take routine service transactions. So, what's my balance, I have a question on how I reset my password, just really trying to take those routine activities and let those be handled by the virtual agent versus those going to a live agent. Now, at any point in time, the customer can opt-out of a virtual agent and go to a live agent. But it really is more around self- assisting and getting those non-value transactions out of the way.",John B. Owen,Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Operating Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_BAAB-Transcript.pdf
answer,"And then also on the contact center side, we are also using the voice of the customer and then the geolocation of the customer also to be using Pindrop as a potential opportunity for us to identify on the fraud side and authentication side also. So, that's another dimension we are going into to help us. So, it's mostly publicly available common information or the information that we know about the customer and their usage patterns [ph] in what we are using more (39:05).",Amala Duggirala,Enterprise Chief Information Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_BAAB-Transcript.pdf

error,Q [indiscernible] (39:14-39:25),,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_BAAB-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah. So the question was one of our peers announced a mid-cycle repurchase and would we consider that and how we think about capital return. So we've been pretty clear that our common equity Tier 1 target is 9.5%. We're at 10.1% today. You saw 80 basis point decline in the first quarter. I wouldn't expect that kind of change going forward. You know now we've front-ended our share repurchase, so earnings will actually catch up with our remaining share authorization that we have from the board and our regulatory supervisors. So we're going to get – we believe we'll get to that 9.5% in 2019. We don't see the need to go out and do it off-cycle. We think we've sent the message pretty clear to our long-term investors what we're going to do. And by executing as large of a share buyback as we have done over the past couple of years and what we just completed should give you confidence that we're on target to get there. And doing an off-cycle, making everybody go through all that just to speed it up just a tad, really we don't see the purpose in doing that.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_BAAB-Transcript.pdf
error,"Q David, maybe one macro question is when you look at this industry, it's been in consolidation for 30 years. There's been very few larger deals announced in the last 10 or 15 years. What's your view on large bank mergers, no premiums, just put the banks together like a Bank One and a JPMorgan from yesteryear? And what do you think about that kind of consolidation theme at some point in the future?",,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_BAAB-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah, [ph] Gerard (41:12), right now all – so you've heard a lot of things going on at this conference just from those that have presented. There are a lot of moving parts right now that are keeping people busy, implementation of a lot of technology projects. If you were to do a big transaction and try to put two companies together, that is really – it's hard to do in a normal environment, trying to do it now with all the things that all of us have going on means something has to – it can't get done. And we believe in the case of Regions, optimization of our franchise is more important to us right now. Leverage technology, to get our capital optimized, to become more efficient is really what's in order for us. And if I polled my peers at the other institutions, I suspect they're going through the same kinds of things we are, and throwing an acquisition in there, I don't think would be in the cards at this point in time. Not to mention, and I hate to say where we are in the cycle, but we're nine years into this run – doesn't mean it can't stop, because we haven't been growing all that rapidly. So, I'm not calling for the economy to roll over right now – write that in your notes. But I am saying that with some uncertainty that the market's in, at least over the past 15 days, why do you want to do that and create even more uncertainty? That risk is too high, I believe.","David J.

error,Q [indiscernible] (42:43-43:01),,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_BAAB-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah. So, the question was how do we think about leveraging capital to grow noninterest revenue sources given the fact that we sold Regions Insurance Group. So, we went the other way. We believe all of our businesses need to earn their right to the capital that we give them. We weren't making the kind of return we needed to make on Regions Insurance. It was great people and they're going to have great careers where they landed and we're happy for them, some of them got really big jobs. But we just couldn't make it work for us. We weren't big enough in it. And so, we let that go. We understand and we'd like to have more noninterest revenue. Our two growth areas are service charges and card and ATM fees through account growth, card growth, and we're having that. So, we feel good there. Growing assets under management and wealth is important to us. And we know the market will help us, or it can hurt, depending on which direction it's going in, but hiring more wealth advisers is important to us. Mortgage will be challenging this next year just like it was this year because the rates are going to be going up. Housing supply in our markets are about four, four and a half months. So, there's not as much activity as we would like. We have outperformed the market because we're more of a purchase shop versus a refinance shop. But we're trying to offset that by hiring more mortgage loan originators, looking for mortgage servicing right acquisitions and using our capital there because we have some excess capacity in our servicing center. Those have become very expensive because everybody now wants them in a rising rate environment. So we have to be careful about utilizing our capital inefficiently. Capital markets has been an area where we've wanted to grow. That has four or five businesses inside of it where we've hired talent to really help us. BlackArch Partners in the M&A group would be an example there. We're going to continue to make those kind of investments, [ph] Ken (45:03), where it's more people specific. If there's a company that could help us grow faster that we could – non-bank company that can help us from a noninterest revenue source, we would consider that. What we have found is they're just expensive, because everybody wants the same thing. And so, if it's too expensive, then you just have to do it slower and more organically. But we would love to use our capital for that.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_BAAB-Transcript.pdf
error,"Q Maybe one final question coming back to technology. Many of the regional banks feel they can compete against the giant universal banks. What metrics do you guys recommend?

question,"Thank you. So maybe, I'm going to start my questions by going back to the Simplify and Grow initiative that you opened up with John. And you've talked about it being both revenue and almost more revenue-oriented than efficiency-oriented, but marrying the both of these aspects, which is important. And you also mentioned low retail deposit betas, and your deposits are very sticky. Your customer experience scores are very, very good. So, when you think about the end point and where you're going with this, it sounds like this is more forward-looking than catch-up investment, but how do you think about what that end point is? How do you gauge that on an absolute basis and relative to peers, how do you know if you're getting a step ahead, or you're moving in sync?",Susan Roth Katzke,Analyst,Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_credit-suisse-transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah. You know I think it's – it's ever evolving. I'm not sure that we'll ever get to an endpoint. It's hard for us to ever imagine being a leader in technology, so I'm not sure we'll ever get ahead so to speak, we're going to be a close follower, that's been our history. You can see from David's presentation, we've made a number of investments already in technology and digital platforms that help us – impacts our customer experience. I think we'll know how we're doing as we see our growth in metrics like household, checking accounts, cards, card utilization, continues to accelerate and importantly retention of customers improve over time. That will be a proxy for us. But I think it's going to be a continuing evolving experience and we're going to have to pay attention to all the trends in the business.",John Turner,President & Head of Corporate Banking Group,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_credit-suisse-transcript.pdf
question,"Sounds about right, in this evolving banking industry. When we think about your investments in the capital markets and I want to tie this in to loan growth broadly and you acknowledge that post-tax reform there's maybe some extra liquidity in the market. And we don't really see much of a pickup in commercial loan demand in the [ph] H8 (00:27:03) data. But what are you hearing from your customers right now and given what capital markets capabilities you do have, how much displacement are you seeing between loan demand into the debt capital markets given just how welcoming they are right now?",Susan Roth Katzke,Analyst,Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_credit-suisse-transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah. The third quarter was obviously I think everybody said this a very active quarter as customers did impact the capital markets at an accelerating rate, probably more active than we'd see that in any of the course, over the [ph] prior two or three years (00:27:31). Seeing a little bit of activity in the first quarter but for the most part I would say that it's just been a fairly quiet start to the year. Our expectation is that we will see more loan growth toward the back half of the year. As we talk to our customers, they are focused on making investments, that they had not contemplated a year ago – two years ago whether it would be in fixed assets or it be an expansion of their businesses or new facilities and their customers likewise are doing the same, because it's important to us to get feedback not only from our customers, but from their customers' customers. And so I do think the marketplace is reacting to tax reform in a positive way. But there are other factors like a tremendous amount of liquidity in the market today that we think are just going to make loans – are going to impact loan growth potentially negatively initially. And so, it'll be more back half loaded. Our expectations are still sort of 2% to 4% for business loan growth and that hasn't changed.",John Turner,President & Head of Corporate Banking Group,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_credit-suisse-transcript.pdf
question,"Okay. You acknowledge your conservatism in your interest rate sensitivity outlook with your rate hikes as well as the 2.50% on the 10-year. And I'm right there with you in my model, so I understand that completely and you look at where the 10-year is today, and given where it's been over the last few years it's hard to believe that it will stick. But I'm curious from where you're sitting today, given the macro backdrop it seems like it could stick here for longer. And so, as you manage your securities portfolio, and your liquidity deployment, what changes are you making? Are you deploying more of the liquidity today? Are you contemplating extending duration in any way? How is that changing?",Susan Roth Katzke,Analyst,Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_credit-suisse-transcript.pdf
answer,"Well, I would tell you that the – so the tenure being up higher than when we started this is positive. I don't think extending duration right now getting paid for that is what we want to do, I think continuing to gather low cost deposits making prudent loans, we're going to look at our sensitivity, we brought it down just a tad, in the past quarter. As the market continues to provide to us our expectations of where the rate environment should be – what rates ought to be, to give us the kind of margin and return on capital, we will start to bring down that sensitivity. I don't know that there that we're there yet, there's still some volatility in the market, but you're looking out at the probability of a short-term rate increase of about 88% from March, it's about 55% in June and if I recall 23% in September. So, right now the market's forecasting pretty good rate increases for which we're going to have more pressure on deposit betas. That being said, we should be able to outperform our peers because of our deposit base that we have. So, we are still in 3% to 5% range, I did say if the rate environment stays where it is right now, perhaps we perform at the higher end of that.","David J.

answer,"Well, it's a good question. So, we will need some preferred issuance today, we are satisfying a Tier 1 requirement with Common Equity is too expensive. We need to trade that out. We've been pretty upfront with that. So we could see something towards the backend of the year. As we think about opportunities today versus what might exist in the market risk that we have to take. Our issue is we just can't stand the negative carry on it right now, so to do something today without being able to use the proceeds to trade out through common equity, just doesn't seem to be in order for us. We still have this thing called the CCAR, we have to go through the process, we'll submit our plan in April or early April and we'll execute from there, but you're right we have $800 million to $1 billion worth of preferred we'll do over time.","David J.

question,"So going back to your rate sensitivity for a minute and potential pressure on deposit betas. Your loan to deposit ratio runs 400 basis points, 500 basis points below your peer group, where do you see that going should it come up to the peer group level, is there a ceiling on where you want to go?",Susan Roth Katzke,Analyst,Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_credit-suisse-transcript.pdf
answer,"Well, the ceiling, it used to be we would – we'd take $10 billion out of market overnight and have 100% plus loan deposit ratio and I don't think I would sleep much at night having that. So we're in the low 80s, I think over time you'll see that drift up to perhaps the low 90s. And our – that's really a ratio that is – that's the conclusion of the efforts for us gathering good core low-cost deposits which regardless of where we stand on loan deposit ratio. We want all the low-cost deposits we could get and then we want to take all the good prudent loans we can, but we're not going to force the ratios. We're going to look for the good business to go get, it is what it is. So that being said, we don't want to have an overreliance on wholesale funding like we used to have either.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_credit-suisse-transcript.pdf
question,"Okay. And speaking of ratios, payout ratios, CCAR, your required capital – your target capital level of 9.5-or-so- percent, [ph] like sort of that (00:33:43) how you set it at 9.5% since that's an awfully healthy cushion above your minimum? I think from where you are today the distance down to 9.5% is still pretty significant, you returned quite a bit more capital in CCAR 2017. How quickly can you get to the 9.5% and why would you hold your minimum at 9.5% when you really could be 100 basis points south of that?",Susan Roth Katzke,Analyst,Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_credit-suisse-transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah. So, all good questions. We see – let's where else – I'll start with – that was three questions in one. So we build that 9.5% up by starting at 4.5% Common Equity Tier 1. We had 250 basis points of buffer to get to 7%, so we never want to reach 7% and have our capital plans, dividends and the like to be interrupted. Now, we didn't layer on, what we think our risk are in our business and so we have done this calculation for some time and we got to – it's actually a little less than 9.5% we rounded it up, and so we're at 10.9%, we have that round numbers $1.4 billion for to get there. What we've said is that our 9.5% when a risk profile was a little riskier than it is today and as our risk continues to come down, you would expect 9.5% to drift down somewhat. If we layer on more risk, then that 9.5% will go up, but it's a great point to say why 9.5%, it could potentially be a little lower than that, but you're at 10.9% and you're so far away to be that - [indiscernible] (00:35:22)","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_credit-suisse-transcript.pdf
answer,"– on another 50 basis points. Let us get to there, and answer the last part of your question is – as we can get pretty close to that by the end of the year. We can't quite – we don't think we can quite get there, but pretty close. So we'll see, we'll submit our capital plan in the first part of April and we'll go from what our regulatory supervisors tell us, we can go.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_credit-suisse-transcript.pdf
question,"Okay. Fair enough. We are down to zero on the clock, so I'm going to thank you so much. I will look forward to getting below that 9.5% this time next year.

answer,"Yes. We're passing the microphone, so we'll start. [ph] That's how we will (48:37) identify I guess.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_Investor-Day-2019-Transcript.pdf
question,"Thanks. Hi. John Pancari, Evercore ISI. You mentioned not interested or the market conditions aren't right for M&A. I had to go there first, sorry.",John Pancari,Analyst,Evercore ISI,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_Investor-Day-2019-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Surprise, surprise.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_Investor-Day-2019-Transcript.pdf
question,"I know. I'm sure you had a bet how quickly it will come up. Well, someone won. So, I know you mentioned market conditions aren't right, so does that mean if you had the currency that you'd be interested as an acquirer? And then on the flip side of that, just given the BB&T and SunTrust deal, can you talk about what it would mean to you if you were still part of an M&A transaction and combining with the buyer from that perspective to compete more effectively given the scale of that deal? Thanks.",John Pancari,Analyst,Evercore ISI,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_Investor-Day-2019-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah. So, first question is if we had a stronger currency and buyer, I think we're always looking at ways to improve the quality of our franchise, improve returns for our shareholders. And so, we're actively viewing the market, we're building relationships, we're trying to understand transactions that occur. But in the end, as you'll see later today, we do really believe that the quality of our plan is really sound and will deliver really solid results. M&A is distracting and it will be disruptive, and we think that we've got to continue to improve our business to be best positioned to take advantage of an acquisition opportunity if it came along. By continuing to improve our business, we will strengthen our currency, and we think then we will have some opportunities. So, if our currency were stronger, we would be looking as we look today, but we would be active. It would have to be really the right opportunity for us, and we want to be very disciplined in that regard. With respect to combinations, again, we've got to earn the right to acquire. Everyday we've got to earn the right to remain independent every day. And that means executing on our plans, doing the things that we believe we can do to deliver solid returns for our shareholders. And if we do that, we don't think we need to combine with anybody. But we're always going to consider and have to consider any opportunity that might come along.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_Investor-Day-2019-Transcript.pdf
question,"Chris Spahr with Wells Fargo Securities. So, of the tech budget, what is the growth rate that you expect over the next two to three years? And at what point do you think it will become self-funding and how much cost-savings do you expect from ROSIE, Reggie, and other initiatives. Thanks.",Christopher Spahr,Analyst,Wells Fargo Securities LLC,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_Investor-Day-2019-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah, just to comment on the technology budget. That $625 million for 2019, just putting in perspective for you, if we go back five years, we're up roughly $100 million. So, we have had growth in our technology spend over the last five years. I think that's going to level off a little bit. I think we've pretty much covered a lot of our key platforms that I talked about from a business standpoint. I think we have good, solid, business platforms. We don't have any big deficits. We'll continue to make investments in mobile and online, but that's going to be an ongoing thing. So, I think $625 million is not going to grow at the same pace it grew in the last five years. Cyber, we will spend what we need to spend on cyber as new technologies become available, but feel good where we are.",John B. Owen,Chief Operating Officer & Senior Executive Vice President,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_Investor-Day-2019-Transcript.pdf
question,"Hi. Saul Martinez at UBS. I [ph] won't lead (52:08) the consolidation theme alone. I guess I'll ask the question in a slightly different way, John. Are there circumstances or under what circumstances do you think that Regions could be worth more as part of a larger organization versus on a standalone basis?",Saul Martinez,Analyst,UBS Securities LLC,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_Investor-Day-2019-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah. I mean, clearly, the real value of our businesses in our deposit franchise. And we think, as I've said, we've [indiscernible] (52:36) in really strong markets and we think we have really solid deposit gathering capabilities. Our board has challenged us with that very question. I don't really have an answer for you today. I think we've got to think through. We're trying to understand frankly the BB&T and SunTrust merger where we're trying to gain insights about it. And it appears, based upon the presentation they made, to be a very good deal for their shareholders, assuming that they can combine the companies in the manner that they think they can. Again, the one challenge to all that is that putting the companies together will be difficult. And so, as we deliver, show you our targets this afternoon, our risk is in execution or in some changing dynamic in the economy that we're not aware of. And so, we believe that we can execute solidly on our plans.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_Investor-Day-2019-Transcript.pdf
question,Great. Helpful. And I guess a follow-up on SunTrust and BB&T. Do you see it more of as a threat of a larger competitor? Do you see it more as an opportunity to maybe pick away some of their business and bankers and employees and whatnot?,Saul Martinez,Analyst,UBS Securities LLC,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_Investor-Day-2019-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah. I mean, I think there are multiple ways to look at it. Assuming that they can successfully combine, and we certainly think they can. It's two great banks led by two really good bankers. They will be a formidable competitor in the markets where we compete. Having said that, they're both very good competitors today. And so, when they combine, two becomes one, we have one less competitor in many of the markets that we compete in, and that's a good thing for us. I do think that there will likely be some disruption that occurs from the combination. And as a result, we hope to gain customers and potentially some bankers. We wish them very well in the transaction, but I want to take advantage of when the opportunities do present themselves.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_Investor-Day-2019-Transcript.pdf
question,"Thank you. Gerard Cassidy, RBC Capital Markets. John, John Owen that is, can you share with us – we hear from many banks about their tech spending. Many of us were across the street yesterday and heard that presentation about tech spending. What measures should we be looking at to see what advantage some banks may have over others because of the technology that they're employing in the digital channel? And then a second question, you mentioned 80% of your sales is still coming through brick and mortar. In five years where do you see that number going down to?",Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_Investor-Day-2019-Transcript.pdf
answer,"When we look at technology span and I knew a lot of questions are going to come up about the scale of thing. And we look at it more from what does the customer think versus how much we spend, and we look at, from a customer standpoint, we use J.D. Powers, we use Kantar, we use Gallup, and they gauge our channels from our customer standpoint. So, I think more importantly than what you spend is what your customers are telling you about what you've done. I mentioned our online banking was ranked as number one over the last three quarters in a row, so I feel good about what we have in terms of business platforms, our mobile and online platforms. I think they're up to date and state-of-the-art. And I think the most important thing is what your customers are telling you. Kantar just recently did a survey of retail banking in the U.S. and they ranked all U.S. retail banks and they came out recently and number one was USAA, which is a great institution, and number two is Regions. And so, we look at that and that's all from customer experience and how customers interact with their organization. So, we look at that first and foremost. Secondly is around capabilities. Are we delivering the capabilities that our customers need to do the business they need to do? And again, I think we are and I think there are places where we will continue to invest over time But again I think we're in a good place. So, scale to me is much more about capabilities and customer experience than how much you spend.",John B. Owen,Chief Operating Officer & Senior Executive Vice President,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_Investor-Day-2019-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Gerard, I'd add just in terms of what metrics do we look at or what markers are we interested in, are we growing consumer checking accounts. And I mentioned we are for six years in a row. Are we growing consumer deposits particularly consumer demand deposits and consumer savings deposits, and we are? So, those things to me, in addition to as John says, do customers prefer our capabilities, do we get favorable results from feedback from customers, the answer is yes. But at the end of the day, are we growing? And if we're growing, I think that's the greatest proxy for are we keeping up delivering the right capabilities.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_Investor-Day-2019-Transcript.pdf
question,"Hi. Thanks. Betsy Graseck, Morgan Stanley. A couple of questions on that, one related to how much market share you think you can take in your current footprint. You highlighted very clearly how you're in a good spot in much of your market and highlighted the 70% where you don't have money center competition. And then the follow-on to that is, are you going to use the technology that you have to go outside of your footprint into areas where you don't have traditional branches today? And I think you might have referenced that in some of the markets you talked about earlier. But give us a little bit more sense as to how, nationwide, you're looking to go with your platform?",Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_Investor-Day-2019-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah. So, as I said earlier, we operate – some of our businesses operate on a national scale, but we're not pursuing national businesses or pursuing a national platform. We don't intend to develop a digital bank. We have great digital banking capabilities we think and customers can do all the things we need to do. We believe fundamentally that we can raise all the deposits we need within our 15-state footprint. We think we have lots of good opportunities, as I said, in our markets. We think we have very good deposit gathering capabilities. And so, our focus is going to be on in-footprint businesses built around relationships that will be long-lasting, profitable, and sound. With respect to our market share growth, we've generally said we want to grow with the economy plus a little where we have significant share. We think oftentimes we get more than the economy grows, where we have lesser share, and we're working to build our market share over time. So, it's going to vary from market-to-market, but we ought to grow with the economy plus a little if we're having success.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_Investor-Day-2019-Transcript.pdf
question,"And with the technology that you have developed, you're obviously creating significant amount of scale for your own organization. So, why not take that to other organizations, right? I mean, it's the M&A question and I get the whole conversation that we had already around multiple on things like that. But you highlighted very clearly that you're well ahead of your regional peers. So, at what point is that a tipping point for you?",Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_Investor-Day-2019-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah. Well, again, I think the first question is, are the economics right, can we do a transaction, not pay too much for the transaction? And given where we trade today versus many of the smaller banks that we might have some interest in combining with, we just don't think that there's a transaction to be economically done. Set that aside, again, and we think there's still lots of improvement to be made in our business if we just focus on our plan. So we don't want to get distracted by an M&A opportunity. Yes? Oh, yeah, okay, Marty.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_Investor-Day-2019-Transcript.pdf
question,"Marty Mosby, Vining Sparks. I was going to ask kind of a two-part question but when you look at your regions and what you said were different in your markets where you don't have the competition from the money center banks, yet the incremental markets that you're going to are the markets that all the other money center banks are going to. So in my mind, there's this pivot that either you grow in that area and then it's really going back to the M&A part. If you go the bigger metro areas, you're a better franchise to be taken over down the road or be merged with somebody else down the road. If you focus on the smaller markets, that really is where you have your advantage where you can leverage everything that you have and your independence really becomes much more of an interesting or viable approach. So I just wanted you to talk about those two elements, and how you think about which markets you're growing into.",Marty Mosby,Analyst,Vining Sparks IBG LP,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_Investor-Day-2019-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah. We think we can do both. We want to continue to protect and grow the core markets that we're in. We want to continue to optimize our franchise in those markets and to grow those markets. At the same time, we think there's an opportunity to take advantage of our style of banking in markets that present tremendous deposit gathering opportunities. We have to be a niche player in places like Houston, Atlanta, Orlando, to your point where we're facing larger competitors. But we think we have all the capabilities. Our unique approach to local and the way we team together we think differentiates us. And those markets are present – they're so large, they present real opportunities for us to grow our business and do it in a very targeted and focused way. And so we think the combination of those two things helps us continue to build a very consistently performing sustainable business. And assuming we can do that and deliver the kinds of returns that we'll share with you later today. We think that dictates our future.","John M.

answer,"No. Our consumer team would be a little more targeted and focused on the type of customer we would want in consumer. Our commercial teams, again probably a little more targeted and focused, but I wouldn't say that we have – think about it in different segments. It's the same customer in Jackson, Mississippi that we want to try to win in Houston as well. Yes.","John M.

error,"Q I don't have a mic but I'm going to try to speak loudly. When you think about the technology bundle of $625 million, roughly $250 million is for new product development or innovation, whatever you want to call that. And you've got – thank you – you've got peers like whether it's now the SunTrust-BB&T combination or USB, which are double or larger. What do you think is the difference then between what else they may be investing in [indiscernible] (01:03:40) for one? Number second, is there something on your wish list which is sort of like to have, but not critical right now but it's further down? Can you either talk through it from both those perspectives?",,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_Investor-Day-2019-Transcript.pdf
answer,"No, I feel very good about our technology spend, very confident. Like I mentioned before, over the last five years, we have gone up by $100 million. So I think we're spending at the places we need to and I go back to – I think it's about what your customer viewpoint is, what do the customers think about your system, how fast you're growing the business, how fast you're getting adoption. I'll go back to our digital adoption. Our 18 to 24 and 25 to 34 year olds were outpacing all of our peers. And so I think we're at a good place. I don't really worry that some of our competitors spend $10 billion or $9 billion or $1.5 billion. They've got a larger base to cover. So let's take Chase, for example. They've got several thousand branches to make sure that they keep up to date with hardware and software. We've got 1,450. We've got 1,900 ATMs. They've got 6,000 ATMs. So they're just by nature going to spend more. They're international bank. We're not international. The complexity of their systems and the number of different systems they have, they're going to spend more. But the fact that they spend more doesn't say that they're doing things that we can't do or we haven't done. We're pretty far out in front with AI. We're pretty far out in front with data and analytics, and so I feel good about our spend. I think it has more to do with the customer viewpoint and capabilities.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_Investor-Day-2019-Transcript.pdf

question,"Hey, guys. It's Jimmy Hanna, North Reef Capital. Just the question is really around how you evaluate, what the right level of growth is or said another way what the acceptable level of growth is. So in the near term, I can see some reasons why Regions should potentially outgrow peers: the disruption in the market from the BB&T- SunTrust deal; population growth, I think you showed – I don't have the slides in front of me but you showed one of the slides where I think your markets are growing 3% plus population growth; and then the third one being to Simplify and Grow. I know I'm not getting all of the expense saves to the bottom line because some of those expense savings would be invested for growth initiatives. So it seems like there's some reasons why Regions should outgrow peers in the short-term intermediate term? But how would you evaluate what the right level of growth is? And then in context, I listened to the checking account growth and it sounded like maybe 1% growth in primary checking account. So is that a good enough level of growth? Maybe you can just speak to that. Thanks.",James H. Hanna,Portfolio Manager,North Reef Capital LLC,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_Investor-Day-2019-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah. So with respect to your last question, Scott Peters can answer this better than I can, but I don't – our belief is that that 1.4% consumer checking account growth is a really solid number within the industry. We don't see – peer data's not published, but we have the benefit I think of seeing some peer data through trade associations. We think that's actually a very good number and again, translation to 4.2% consumer demand and 5% consumer savings growth. So we think that's positive. Year in and year out, we think our business ought to grow sort of with the economy plus a little. There'll be times we grow a little faster, times where we grow a little slower. We can't necessarily dictate the flow of business. We had a very good fourth quarter. Our pipelines were full. We closed a lot of business first quarter of 2019. We benefit from the fourth quarter, but pipelines are a little softer. So as you think about our business, it's going to ebb and flow. We would target growing sort of with the economy plus a bit. Again, as you'll see later today, we don't have to grow a lot to deliver on what we think are really quality results. And at this point in the economic cycle, we could go – the economic cycle could go on for a number of years. But many are speculating we may be nearing some softening in the economy. And if that's true, we certainly don't want to be growing faster than our peers, heading into a downturn. We did that in 2007 and 2008 and it didn't work out very well. So we want to be thoughtful. This is the time to focus on quality, on client selectivity, on sound underwriting, and just being real mindful about the fundamentals of our business, and we're going to do that. That's time's up so we'll have time for questions, if you want to ask John or me later when we conclude, we'll take a 15 minute break and start back at 9:25? Thank you.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_Investor-Day-2019-Transcript.pdf
unknown,"John M. Turner, Jr. President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp. Okay. We'll get started again. So we had intended to put the presentations out as they were being made as we did last time and our webcast got a little ahead of us, so you may have noticed that all of the presentations have been now downloaded. Hopefully, you have access to them. I think David's presentation was last to be downloaded and you should have it, if not right this minute then shortly. Yeah, yeah, please still pay attention. That would be nice. So I want to introduce our next three presenters. They're our business segment leaders and the first is Ronnie Smith. Ronnie leads our Corporate Banking Group, which includes Corporate Banking, commercial banking, real estate banking, treasury management, asset lending businesses, specialized industries, capital markets. Ronnie has been a banker for over 35 years. He began his career as a management trainee with Deposit Guaranty, which was many you might remember, a predecessor to Regions Bank. Ronnie spent his entire career in markets as a banker, leading bankers, working with bankers and has a great feel for the business and for our bankers and our customers. And he does a super job leading the business. I think you'll be interested in hearing Ronnie's plans. Scott Peters, who runs our Consumer Banking business leads retail, mortgage and indirect lending, will follow Ronnie. Scott has a 30-plus year career in the financial services industry having worked for KeyBank, for Citibank, Fidelity before joining Regions in 2004. Scott is really passionate about Consumer Banking. He's on the board of BAI, the Consumer Bankers Association, done a great job for us, been the catalyst architect behind much of the innovation and change in our Consumer Bank, our making banking easier and our retail network strategy. So I know you'll enjoy hearing from Scott and about our plans in Consumer Bank. And then finally, Bill Ritter who began his career in 1993 at Regions as a commercial banker or probably as a management trainee and then a commercial banker, has again been working with bankers all of his career, both 20 as a commercial banker and leading commercial bankers. We asked Bill to run wealth banking in 2011, and he is the architect of our current wealth strategy. One of the things that makes Bill unique and frankly makes Bill, Scott and Ronnie unique because they've all worked with bankers, they've all worked with customers. They've all been bankers facing customers. So they understand our business well, understand our markets. Bill, because wealth banking is so dependent upon referrals, internal referrals for a lot of our success, Bill brings a unique perspective having been a commercial banker. And I think he's doing a great job leading wealth banking. So I'll now turn it over to Ronnie. When Bill is finished, just as we did a few minutes ago, we'll have time for Q&A of the business leaders. Thank you.

unknown,"Ronald G. Smith Senior Executive Vice President & Head of Corporate Banking Group, Regions Financial Corp. Yeah, thank you, John, and let me thank each of you for being here today and for the interest that you have in our company. There are three topics that I would like to cover from a Corporate Banking standpoint that we think are absolutely critical to our success. You've heard some of these before, but it's critical for us. Number one is just a really strong risk management foundation. We believe that we have that, but we will continue to improve that along the way. And then, our go-to-market strategy is critical for us as well. We think it's unique and we'll take a little bit of a deeper dive into what that looks like for us. And then, we'll talk – Jimmy, as I've promised at the break, we'll talk about drivers of success and some of the investments that we will make in the business as we go forward. Before we get there though, let's take a quick look at the overview of the Corporate Bank. We break this business or our group down into three businesses: commercial middle market that moves up to $250 million in sales – Bill Horton is here and he runs that business for us; and then large corporate, which Ward Cheatham handles for us as well, picks up at that point and also the specialized groups John Turner mentioned earlier sit in that particular category; and then real estate. If you look at the number of clients that these businesses manage, it's over 26,000. They manage $47 billion of deposits, $27 billion of loans (sic) [$27 billion of deposits, $47 billion of loans] (01:13:55) and that produces just under $2 billion of revenue. One of the things that we're very pleased with is how that mix has changed over the past three year period. When John Turner had this role a few years ago in 2015, we set an aspirational goal that we would move noninterest revenue from 22% up to 28%. And I'm happy to put another green check mark on that when we made that target in 2018, and we like where that trend is taking us on a go-forward basis. When you think about the foundation of risk management, it starts with client selectivity. You can't pick a bad client and structure them to become a good one. And so, we are focused on those companies that have a reason to exist, well capitalized, proven ability to work through the cycle. And so client selectivity is critically important. But also important is really solid underwriting, rigorous monitoring and then once we get those three things in line where we really place our focus is on diversification and we do that – Barb will talk about this just a little bit later, but we do that by having really strong concentration policies from an industry standpoint and you can see that in this next slide on our commercial and industrial business. We start off with the most loan exposure, loan outstanding dollars in the government and the education area and that represents 15%. Certainly not an outlier but as you move down the list, we go all the way down to 1% from an 21 Regions Financial Corp. (RF) Corrected Transcript Investor Day 27-Feb-2019 agricultural exposure. But all of these industries are strongly supported by the industry and product experts that we talked about before, we get the best of both worlds there because we're leveraging up industry and product expertise with local bankers. We get local bankers deep relationships and they become very involved with our industry and product experts to bring about best-in-class client solutions. The group that has faced the most change though has been our investor real estate group. Many of you that I know in the room followed us when we put two banks together in the 2006-2007 category. And when we did, both banks had an outsized exposure to investor real estate. And not only were we outsized in the exposure, comparing that back to the total loan portfolio, we were out of balance from a product standpoint. Of all the slides that I will show you today, this is the one that is the most dramatic and it's the one that I am so pleased with what the group has been able to accomplish since 2007. Look, they have positioned us to be in a very solid area, 7% of our loan balances compared to the [ph] top company (01:17:10) now reside in investor real estate compared to our peer group that's at 13%. This group has positioned us to grow. But don't make any mistake about it, our growth in this category is focused on well capitalized companies with proven ability to work through the cycle that all of you know inevitable in this business. We're being very selective but we did see growth in 2018, especially in the second half of the year. If you take a look backwards on the point- to-point growth in investor real estate, it was a 6% point-to-point growth, very healthy and focused on those kind of relationships that we're looking for from an investor real estate standpoint. This next topic is one that you're not aware of, I'm sure. We only hear about it every week. Some of you write articles about it. We get a question every week about this particular topic. Today's goal is to be as transparent about our leverage lending portfolio as we can possibly be. Barb will talk about some of the definitional standpoints and the differences and some of the inconsistencies that you have from one organization to the next. But I'll take a swing at what we are interested in from a marketing standpoint versus what we're not. Maybe it's easier for me to start with what we are not interested in. From a leverage standpoint, these are limited dollars for us because of the concentration limits that we talked about a little bit earlier. We are not interested in any leverage loan for the loan's sake only. This is not a transaction approach for us; this is a relationship approach for us. If we can't find the right client, who is willing to provide us with opportunities for broader and deeper growth and moving in the right risk metrics, then we do not have interest there. There's good diversity as you can see, if you'll notice in the bottom right-hand corner of this particular slide, you can see there's good diversification. Information and manufacturing both make up 17% of that, and you can walk your way down the rest of those categories because we're looking for diversification, but we're looking for opportunity for relationships moving in the right direction, willing to build something a little bit broader. If you also take a look at the left-hand side of the slide in the bottom left-hand corner, we have $1.5 billion of deposit balances on loan balances outstanding of $5.5 billion, 25% compensating balances in this business point to the importance of us and what we're doing by developing broader and deeper relationships. We love our go-to-market strategy. As a matter of fact, it starts with our client at the very center of what we do. Those clients, as John Turner said in his opening comments, face off against the businesses that we described just a few minutes ago. And those businesses are supported by industry and product experts. You can see on the right-hand side of the slide, the product offerings that we have in our specialized vertical area, capital markets, treasury management and our Regions Business Capital group. We believe that we have the 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2019 FactSet CallStreet, LLC Regions Financial Corp. (RF) Corrected Transcript Investor Day 27-Feb-2019 products that are needed to serve the markets that we serve today and to meet the needs of our clients. We believe in this because we get the best of both worlds. In many cases, our local RMs have relationships that have [ph] expanded (01:21:07) over decades. And those are relationships that are valued by those particular clients. On the other hand, they may not have the industry and product experts that we have in these particular markets. And so they're able to call in resources to help them bring about the best-in-class client solution. And look, it's an efficient model for us as well. There's no way possible that we could take all of the industry and product experts and put them in the various markets that we're in today. Today this group represents 10% of the head count of our company. We produce 33% of the revenue and 40% of the profit. And what we haven't given up on is the service levels. You've heard both John and John talk about the service levels just a moment ago and more than 12 times, Greenwich has recognized us for having Best in Brand, best in service. And so we stay focused on that service and it speaks to this model that we strongly believe in. When we successfully execute that partnership, you can see what happens on the left-hand side of this particular slide, you can see what happens to our RAROC models and also the percentage of revenue and profitability that the verticals are helping us drive. Diversification again is critically important to us, in the right-hand bottom corner of this slide, and you can see where the vertical activity is taking place. So, again, that partnership is the epitome of something that we refer to and many of you know as Regions360. It's working across lines to bring about the best solutions that we can. Capital recycling has already been mentioned a couple of times today and it's very important for us. We have capital that it takes to support lending activities. And yes, there are times that we lead from a loan standpoint, but when we cannot find our way to build a broader and deeper relationship, we make some of the tough decisions to move away from those relationships and we provide ourselves with the opportunity to take the capital and redeploy it with relationships that make sense to us. In 2016, John Turner put in place something called the Capital Commitment Working Group and it was a simple discipline. We meet once a week and we review all of our loans that have not been able to have a broader and deeper relationship. It's a manual process for us, but let me tell you what it does. It drives culture through our company in a very strong way. And you can see what's happened as a result of the focus that we're really giving this very important recycling approach, economic capital, which is just a placeholder for how much capital that we assign to each loan based on how we view that risk, has been driven down by 110 basis points. And on the other side of that, our profitability continues to move up and the reason it's moving up is not because we're getting a higher price on our loan pricing, but because we're getting better opportunities to sell across the needs of those particular companies. We'll continue this process. It is part of our go-to-market strategy and it's one that continues to prove that when we get capital deployed to the right relationship, it makes a big difference for us. You can't talk about our go-to-market strategy without mentioning our solid core markets – markets like Mobile, Alabama; Montgomery, Alabama; Jackson, Mississippi; Shreveport, Louisiana. As a matter of fact, John mentioned this just a moment ago but I had the opportunity in my career to spend more than 20 years in client- facing roles in these particular markets. What I can tell you firsthand is that not only do we believe in those relationships, those clients view us with great respect. As a matter of fact, in many cases, we represent for those clients the money center bank that delivers on a community bank basis and the clients value that relationship. 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2019 FactSet CallStreet, LLC Regions Financial Corp. (RF) Corrected Transcript Investor Day 27-Feb-2019 And in these particular markets, it's not necessarily where we bank. I know if you pull up some of the demographics, you'll find out that these are not the fastest-growing markets that we have, but they are profitable markets for us. And the reason why is because the businesses that we bank in our core markets are not limited by city limits or state lines. I can't tell you the number of times in that 20-plus-year period that I had the privilege of working in those areas that we saw our companies grow from just a city company to a statewide organization to a regional organization and, in some cases, having a national presence. And by the way, because of the loyalty that we have from those clients, we get to grow with them. 70% of our new revenue comes from existing relationships. Now a lot of that is due to the fact that we're really focused on Regions360, but a good portion of that is because we get to grow with those companies that are in those markets that may not have the best demographics that you would look for, but those companies once again are moving past what those particular markets provide for them today. We do have really opportunities in our growth markets. We've identified three cities – Atlanta, Houston and Orlando – that Bill and Scott and I are locking arms on over the next three-year period, and we plan to have a synergistic approach in these particular markets. And you can tell why. Just take a look at several of the facts that you find below those particular cities. We already have some density there. Scott will talk about this a little bit later, but he'll be making investments in our branch delivery system. And Bill and I will be making investments in people and processes, and our plan is to attack those markets much like we do our core markets today. What we like about these markets is that there's disruption in these markets, and we believe that our culture is a great place for people to come who are feeling disrupted by whatever may be going on in those particular areas. From a Corporate Bank perspective, we also make investments in other growth markets, markets like Dallas and Nashville, Indianapolis and Charlotte. We are making opportunistic hires in those particular markets because of some of the disruption that's occurring there. And if you just look at our year-over-year comparison from 2017 to 2018, we had 7% revenue growth in these markets by making really individual hires with bankers who have great brands in those markets and enjoy the culture that Regions brings to the table. When I think about our growth strategies for the future, it starts with what we are known as, as a company, and that is a very strong deposit franchise. That's true for us also from a Corporate Bank perspective. 80% of our clients keep an operating account with us in the Corporate Bank today. And in 2018, we saw a 3% increase in our year-over-year growth in treasury management, cash management type products and services. That 3%, by the way, is on a very large base. But on our forward focused strategies and in several of the individual meetings that I've had the privilege to attend with several of you, you understand that as rates have moved up, so have the clients' appetite on what they expect from a liquidity standpoint. And we're responding to those needs. First of all, we're asking our, calling our coverage bankers to lead with deposits and our treasury management services. The reason that's important is that is because it's important to those clients today. Look, simply put, not every business has a loan need but every business does have a deposit and a cash management need. And so if we're having those conversations, I promise if they have a loan need, it comes up during those conversations. As rates have moved up, so have earnings credit rates. And it's given our customers the opportunity to have more buying power associated with treasury management products. And so, we're also leading with those 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2019 FactSet CallStreet, LLC Regions Financial Corp. (RF) Corrected Transcript Investor Day 27-Feb-2019 conversations. It's the right thing to do for the client, but it's also the right thing to do for us because it makes for a stickier client with every additional product and service that we're able to provide them along the way. And then we're also opening up more balance sheet opportunities to sweep excess balances to our balance sheet. We have a full array of off-balance sheet opportunities, but our clients tend to lean back into wanting to have that access on our balance sheet. We've seen really good traction in that process already and we believe that that will continue to move forward. When we think about technology, data and analytics and innovation, John Owen mentioned this earlier, John, in your comment about our end-to-end commercial lending process. Just about eight months ago, we developed the team from across our company to take a look at something that we felt like had been in place for quite some time to see if there were more efficiencies. We set that team up in a Lean Six Sigma approach and what we found is that we – over the years, we had created redundancies in our commercial lending approval process. Just by taking out the redundancies and – oh, by the way, before I go any farther, the non-negotiable there is that we could not give up any credit quality standards that we had put in place. But what we did give up were redundancies that had developed within that particular approval process and we have moved it, John, from nine down to three days. It takes the transactions off the Street. It eliminates some of the competition we have. It gives us a higher pull-through rate that our clients enjoy and it makes banking easier for them. We are investing, as John said just a bit earlier, in several of our different platforms: capital markets, commercial lending, equipment finance, and treasury management have either all had new platforms installed over the past year or enhanced platforms that we continue to work on today. And the third block on this particular slide are three things that I'm very excited about. Two of these are really tied at the hip and it's the first two. One is an early warning risk indicator and the other is a share of wallet platform. They actually work on the same platform. You remember the 80% operating accounts that I talked about just a moment ago, these platforms actually extract information out of the cash flows that are occurring within those operating accounts. With the help of outside vendors, we have identified more than 200 data points that we'll be able to pull information out of what's occurring within the cash flows within the operating accounts. That's going to arm our RMs with being much more proactive with our clients than being reactive, not only proactive about potential risk that we see developing with that business, but also anticipating needs that the client has and having proactive conversations with them as we move forward. And then the last thing on the list or at least in this third box is something that we're referring to as a customer portal. It will create a repository of information where we supply industry information that we have about that business. The business does that as well and it allows us to both pull closer and take a look at the business through each other's eyes. There's much more to come with the customer portal. And so, we'll talk about a little bit later as we develop more. But having real-time communication with our clients is absolutely critical in the speed of the world that we live in today. In addition to those things that are so important to u, liquidity management and technology. We ask our teams in our three-year strategic planning process to help us develop where we should go together. What I like about this is that it was a grassroots level where we went to our client-facing RMs and our second line of defense, and it 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2019 FactSet CallStreet, LLC became a team effort. It's an odd number, I know that. It's 11, but it's 11 really good initiatives that were developed by our teams. It ranges from everything from our commercial group and treasury management group that's focused on deeper penetration into our commercial card and the liquidity management that we're talking about a little bit earlier. Our large corporate group will continue to expand verticals certainly [ph] word move (01:35:16) into the areas where we have growth opportunities along the way. And then, from a vertical standpoint, we will expand those verticals to include new opportunities. And within our real estate group, we're expanding our fund sponsor coverage. We're doing a great job doing the projects that we were finding in those fund sponsor coverages. But what we have found by developing a team and we did that in late fourth quarter, we've already seen great traction of noninterest revenue opportunities that we're finding at more of the parent companies along the way. These groups were really hand-in-hand with our capital markets group. Several of you remember a few years ago when we divested our broker-dealer that we started rebuilding our capital markets teams so that we could support our client base just with the needs that they have along the way. And those needs have continued to grow as well as our capital markets team has been able to grow. And it's been a great positive story. Terry Katon is here with us today and he heads that capital markets team for us. I've asked Terry to make a few comments about this slide, which is a dramatic opportunity for us over the last several years and, Terry, where we will go as we move forward.

Just about eight months ago, we developed the team from across our company to take a look at something that we felt like had been in place for quite some time to see if there were more efficiencies. We set that team up in a Lean Six Sigma approach and what we found is that we – over the years, we had created redundancies in our commercial lending approval process. Just by taking out the redundancies and – oh, by the way, before I go any farther, the non-negotiable there is that we could not give up any credit quality standards that we had put in place. But what we did give up were redundancies that had developed within that particular approval process and we have moved it, John, from nine down to three days. It takes the transactions off the Street. It eliminates some of the competition we have. It gives us a higher pull-through rate that our clients enjoy and it makes banking easier for them. We are investing, as John said just a bit earlier, in several of our different platforms: capital markets, commercial lending, equipment finance, and treasury management have either all had new platforms installed over the past year or enhanced platforms that we continue to work on today. And the third block on this particular slide are three things that I'm very excited about. Two of these are really tied at the hip and it's the first two. One is an early warning risk indicator and the other is a share of wallet platform. They actually work on the same platform. You remember the 80% operating accounts that I talked about just a moment ago, these platforms actually extract information out of the cash flows that are occurring within those operating accounts. With the help of outside vendors, we have identified more than 200 data points that we'll be able to pull information out of what's occurring within the cash flows within the operating accounts. That's going to arm our RMs with being much more proactive with our clients than being reactive, not only proactive about potential risk that we see developing with that business, but also anticipating needs that the client has and having proactive conversations with them as we move forward. And then the last thing on the list or at least in this third box is something that we're referring to as a customer portal. It will create a repository of information where we supply industry information that we have about that business. The business does that as well and it allows us to both pull closer and take a look at the business through each other's eyes. There's much more to come with the customer portal. And so, we'll talk about a little bit later as we develop more. But having real-time communication with our clients is absolutely critical in the speed of the world that we live in today. In addition to those things that are so important to u, liquidity management and technology. We ask our teams in our three-year strategic planning process to help us develop where we should go together. What I like about this is that it was a grassroots level where we went to our client-facing RMs and our second line of defense, and it 25 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2019 FactSet CallStreet, LLC became a team effort. It's an odd number, I know that. It's 11, but it's 11 really good initiatives that were developed by our teams. It ranges from everything from our commercial group and treasury management group that's focused on deeper penetration into our commercial card and the liquidity management that we're talking about a little bit earlier. Our large corporate group will continue to expand verticals certainly [ph] word move (01:35:16) into the areas where we have growth opportunities along the way. And then, from a vertical standpoint, we will expand those verticals to include new opportunities. And within our real estate group, we're expanding our fund sponsor coverage. We're doing a great job doing the projects that we were finding in those fund sponsor coverages. But what we have found by developing a team and we did that in late fourth quarter, we've already seen great traction of noninterest revenue opportunities that we're finding at more of the parent companies along the way. These groups were really hand-in-hand with our capital markets group. Several of you remember a few years ago when we divested our broker-dealer that we started rebuilding our capital markets teams so that we could support our client base just with the needs that they have along the way. And those needs have continued to grow as well as our capital markets team has been able to grow. And it's been a great positive story. Terry Katon is here with us today and he heads that capital markets team for us. I've asked Terry to make a few comments about this slide, which is a dramatic opportunity for us over the last several years and, Terry, where we will go as we move forward.",error,error,error,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_Investor-Day-2019-Transcript.pdf
unknown,"Terry Katon Executive Vice President & Head of Regions Bank Capital Markets, Regions Financial Corp. Thanks, Ronnie, and thanks for everyone here for spending time with us. I wanted to talk a little bit about the growth we've in Capital Markets. You can see over the last four years, we've been able to grow the business more than 175%. It's been a compound average growth rate of about 29% during that time. A good portion of this was, as Ronnie mentioned, in 2012, we sold our broker-dealer, and that gave us the opportunity to really take a fresh look at the businesses we want to be in and we have a clean slate to work with. And so, in 2013, we established a new broker-dealer called Regions Securities and oriented the services we were going to offer to our clients to what we saw them meeting in the marketplace. You see as well here some additional products we've added over the last five years. What I would orient you to is we're in three product groups. One is hedging services, and this is foreign exchange, interest rates and commodities, where we help our clients manage the risks in their business. Then, we have capital-raising businesses across the public and private markets to support our corporate, commercial and real estate clients. And then, we've got advisory services, which is primarily our BlackArch M&A platform. You see here, as I mentioned, a number of our product additions. One I might highlight, in 2014, we acquired a Fannie Mae DUS capability that we actually rolled out to our customers in 2015. Barb is going to talk about how we've managed our multi-family exposure in this cycle. But this is a good example where we have a capability there that has enabled us to better manage the risk in that portfolio while creating better returns through more fee income on a smaller portfolio. So real success there. 26 What we found, and this is a good example of the Fannie Mae DUS product, is our customers have really reacted well as we brought out new offerings to them. The way we do business with them has really been rewarded from them and we've grown the business, as you can see, substantially and we've got additional opportunity to do that. The last thing I would mention to you though is we are not – you'll see Ronnie mentioned sales and trading on the loan side is something that we are building out, but we don't trade for profit. We will trade to enable our clients on the investor side to generate better liquidity in their portfolios. But most of our trading activity is to manage the risk in our customer transactions. And so you won't see the kind of volatility in our capital markets P&L that some of our peers exhibit. Thanks, Ronnie.",error,error,error,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_Investor-Day-2019-Transcript.pdf
error,"Ronald G. Smith Senior Executive Vice President & Head of Corporate Banking Group, Regions Financial Corp. Yeah. Thank you. Terry. And when we get these things in alignment, liquidity management, data analytics, technology, and the initiatives that we talked about, it really will drive continued efficiency for us. In 2018, our efficiency ratio was just over 47%. And we feel like we'll have more improvement with that over the next three years and beyond in the 300-basis-point range. And so, we look forward to continuing to focus on how do we get more efficient, how do we grow revenue, and continue to be really good from an expense management standpoint. I'll sum up today where I started. Number one, we clearly understand the importance of strong risk management. We have to do that to afford the right to grow every day and we owe it to you as our investors to be solid risk managers. The second thing is our go-to-market strategy is something that we believe deeply in. We think it sets us apart in the industry. We think of it as our secret sauce. And those partnerships really do allow us to build deep, long relationships that we enjoy. And then last on all the things that I mentioned about healthy growth, we understand that there will be economic changes. But we believe that these 11 initiatives really provide us with a solid pathway for continued improvement as we move forward. Thanks again for your time today. It's my privilege to introduce my partner, Scott Peters, who heads up our Consumer Group, and just a great partner for us on the Corporate Banking side.

unknown,"Scott M. Peters Senior Executive Vice President & Head of Consumer Banking Group, Regions Financial Corp. 27 Regions Financial Corp. (RF) Corrected Transcript Investor Day 27-Feb-2019 And thanks to everyone here today who's joined us to hear the Regions story. It's something we're proud of and excited to present to you. Before I get going on my prepared remarks about the Consumer Bank, we'll see just a brief video to share a little bit with you Regions brand of banking. This video gives you just a brief taste of how we're combining technology and proactive guidance to deliver better outcomes for our customers. It's allowing us to drive more value for them, grow our bank, while, at the same time, become more efficient every day. During my prepared comments today, you'll see a few themes emerge. One is how we're going to lean in to our superior customer service advantage, and the primacy and loyalty of our customer base. Secondly, how we're going to continue to invest in an omni-channel experience that delivers more value for our customers, while, at the same time, allowing us to become more efficient all the time. Third, we use strong data and analytics in everything that we do to target our customers appropriately, to deliver them the right solutions, as well as to prioritize our resources effectively. And fourth, we're going to lean in to a strong operating advantage we have in the mortgage business to grow our share in that business for the long term. Let's jump right in. Regions Consumer Bank drives roughly 58% of the revenue of Regions and about 53% of the pre-provision income. It's split between three businesses. Last year, the retail business delivered 86% of the pre-tax income of the Consumer Bank; mortgage, 12%; and our indirect business, 2%. We operate across 15 states, as was mentioned earlier, with roughly 1,450 branch sites. And we serve over 4.3 million consumer households and 370,000 small businesses. Let's take a quick look at the balance sheet. The Consumer Banking Group has roughly 61% of the deposits of the company. It's a deep and granular deposit base as mentioned already today. About a third of that is in noninterest-bearing accounts, and about half of it is in checking accounts. If we look at the other side of the balance sheet, we have $32 billion of loans, which is just a little shy of 40% of the loans of Regions. 44% of those are first mortgages and 70% are secured by real estate. 16% of our loans are in the indirect business, of which about 60% of those are secured by automobiles. The remainder is split between credit cards, direct loans to our consumers in our retail branches as well as small business loans in our retail branches. All of our product and business strategies are looked at through a lens of risk-adjusted returns and relationship opportunity, and we constantly look at the balance of our business and manage our concentrations. Some examples of that have been how we treated our indirect auto business. Few years ago, we exited a flow arrangement we had in indirect auto because the risk-adjusted returns were challenged when we put it into a runoff portfolio. And as John mentioned earlier today, the risk-adjusted returns on indirect auto business have been very challenged and really so optimal for us. So we are exiting that business with our last fundings occurring right around the end of the first quarter. Additionally, if you look at our mortgage business, we focus on direct origination, not correspondent lending. Direct-originated mortgages drive roughly twice the risk-adjusted returns of correspondent loans. If you look at our credit card portfolio, our relationship approach on credit card portfolio has allowed us to have 80% of our credit card holders actually have a deposit account with Regions as well, once again, driving stronger risk-adjusted returns and better performance through various credit cycles. 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2019 FactSet CallStreet, LLC Regions Financial Corp. (RF) Corrected Transcript Investor Day 27-Feb-2019 Last but not least, we focus on balanced business and managing our concentration limits. We've grown third-party unsecured loans pretty strongly the last couple of years. You will see that level out this year as we start to approach our concentration limits and keep our disciplines around that. Everything we do goes through a filter of risk-adjusted returns. It's so important that we get paid for the risk that we take. Let's talk a little bit about our Consumer Bank strengths. We talked a lot about our markets today. It's a nice combination. We have strong, dependable, and stable markets which give us great sources of income, but we also operate in some of the fastest-growing metros in the United States. As I mentioned earlier, we operate in 15 states. They hold about a third of the United States population. Our core markets reside in the states that you see on this slide in blue. And in those markets, we have some common characteristics across them: strong share, low-cost deposits, high primacy, and very granular loyal relationships. These markets represent between 85% and 87% of our loans, deposits and revenues in our retail bank. They're not only dependable; they're actually growing in a dependable fashion. Over the last three years, these markets have grown at a 3.5% compound annual growth rate in revenues and we can continue to see that happen as we go forward. Add to that the fact that we operate in 24 of the top 50 fastest-growing metros in the United States. These metros lie both within our core markets as well as in other markets that we operate in. You see some of the markets here where we're making investments and as mentioned earlier, in three of those – Atlanta, Houston, and Orlando – we'll be making investments across our lines of business with not only retail distribution investments and consumer investments, but investments in our resources in the Wealth Management area and in the Corporate Banking area. Additionally, we operate in other fast-growing metros where we're having nice growth rates, and we have future opportunities to make investments to accelerate those growth rates as well. Regions360 is our team-based, needs-based approach to bringing all of Regions to our customers every day. It's critically important that the Consumer Bank is especially good at this. We are the storefront for Regions. We really focus on it in two different ways. One of those is through proactive guidance with our certified bankers, which helps fill out all the core needs of our customers. That's really a penetration play that we can execute within our retail branches. But very importantly, when having the right needs-based discussions with skilled bankers, we uncover more complex needs, opportunities to introduce our partners in the Wealth Management area and in the Corporate Banking area to solve those complex needs for our customers. We've had strong results across both of these efforts. First of all, from a penetration perspective, we've increased Regions360 relationships in the Consumer Bank by 3.5% last year. And the Regions360 relationship is very simply a fully valued, fully sold relationship, which drives 140% more revenue than your average Consumer Banking relationship. Great progress on penetration. Additionally, though, we've done a really terrific job of introducing our experts in wealth and corporate to our customers to solve their more complex needs. During 2018, we drove over $170 million of incremental revenue from referrals. Additionally, 30% of all the mortgages that we originated last year were referred from our retail branches, and we introduced over 70,000 clients to our experts in the Wealth Management area for investment advice and investment products. 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2019 FactSet CallStreet, LLC Regions Financial Corp. (RF) Corrected Transcript Investor Day 27-Feb-2019 The hallmark of Regions is our relentless customer focus. I want to reward it with top-docile customer loyalty and very high brand favorability. 75% of our customers indicate that they'd be willing to refer friends and family. And in fact, in 2018, we opened up over 50,000 core checking relationships from referrals from our loyal customers. As John mentioned earlier, 60% of our deposits are held by customers who've been with our bank for over 10 years. And not only do we have loyal customers; we continue to grow. We've consolidated over the last five years 284 branches. In spite of that, we've grown consistently for six years straight and continue to have growth rates that per third-party conversations and relationships appear to be at the top of the industry. And it's not just working with core loyal customers; it's attracting the next generation of banking customers. 50% of our new checking account openings today are with customers under the age of 30. And you see a depiction on this slide of some of the card relationships we have through our Southeastern Conference affiliation being the bank of the Southeastern Conference, and we're fortunate to operate in all these market areas, attracting the next generation of banking customers. It's clearly a strength of ours when we get recognized by numerous third-parties. Here's just a few on this slide. But during 2018, no less than 12 third-parties recognized Regions as the number one or number two financial institution in customer experience, customer satisfaction and customer loyalty. This is clearly a competitive advantage for our bank. And what does it do for us? It drives industry leading primacy with our customers. Over 90% of our checking accounts are the primary checking account of our customers. Why is that important? It provides a stable, low-cost deposits. 92% of all the consumer deposits are held by customers who have their primary checking account with Regions. And we've had great performance across that base, and these primary accounts also have high activity levels with us, which drives noninterest revenues and makes us the first choice for their future financial needs. Our low-cost deposit base is probably the greatest financial contributor to Regions' overall financial results coming out of the Consumer Bank. As mentioned earlier, it's roughly 61% of our deposits. It's a very favorable mix with a lot of noninterest-bearing accounts, about roughly 33%, and we consistently have deposit costs at half our peer averages. And through these rising interest rates cycles, we've had one of the most, if not the best, low deposit beta as we've navigated through those interest rate increases. We have a strong relationship-focused card and payment offering. It's driven high activity and high growth levels. Our debit card portfolio has had the number one Visa power score for 17 straight quarters. The Visa power score takes penetration, activation and utilization to signify the highest-performing debit card portfolio in the industry, and I'd suggest the most profitable one. On the credit card side, we have outpaced industry growth in both spend and balances over the last three years with a compound annual growth rate of spend of 12% over that period and 9% on balances. We've also been an early adopter of payment innovations, wallets as well as real-time payments. And we've introduced proprietary products for our customers like our Regions LockIt card controls, which allow our customers to lock and unlock their card transactions in real time from their mobile device. Additionally, we recently rolled out a great rewards program for our credit card reward customers. Our Rewards Multiplier gives benefit for relationships and has our customers earning additional rewards and multiplying their 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2019 FactSet CallStreet, LLC Regions Financial Corp. (RF) Corrected Transcript Investor Day 27-Feb-2019 rewards based on their deposit relationships with the bank. Clearly, a great relationship product for us to continue to grow. Now, let's talk about how some of these strengths are going to play going forward as we continue to grow the Consumer Bank. First of all, we leverage data and analytics and all that we do. It's absolutely essential for us to understand our customers, understand their behaviors and their desires. This helps us drive our omni-channel approach, meeting our customers where they want to be met. Omni-channel allows us not only to add more value for our customers, but to do so more efficiently every day. We're utilizing geospatial analytics to drive our market strategies and our thin network strategy that allows us to consolidate effectively and grow efficiently in the growth markets that I mentioned earlier. And data and analytics are at the core of our proactive guidance, meeting our customers in every touch point with things like ROSIE that John mentioned earlier. We also are using advanced analytics to not only improve our credit experience, but also improve our credit decisioning and our credit outcomes as well as our ongoing credit monitoring to manage our risks. Our customers expect us to be excellent across all of our channels. We've successfully rolled out digital capabilities and automation that allows our customers to bank when and where they want. We've message to our customers and educated them on the convenience of 24/7 banking, especially for their simple transactions. We've seen extremely strong adoption. This is creating efficiencies for us. It's also allowing us to focus our bankers and our certified bankers on providing more proactive guidance and messaging to our customers, driving more value for them. 90% of all of our customer interactions today are automated or in the digital environment. But 60% of our customers still see value in visiting a branch and spending time getting guidance from our certified bankers. As mentioned earlier, 80% of our sales are generated from our branches and our certified bankers, even as we continue to grow our digital account openings at an aggressive rate. We're taking advantage of all the opportunities across this omni-channel experience. It's driving more customer value, driving more revenues, and it's doing so at lower cost. John mentioned ROSIE earlier. This is – we've operationalized a state-of-the-art system and platform to drive smart guidance to every touch point that we have with our customers. It's core to our strategy. ROSIE updates 350 different characteristics of customers and known prospects every single day. It then drives the next best action to improve the financial life of our customers to all of our touch points, where we can meet the customer as they come into us in a reactive nature with some good sound advice or we can reach out to them proactively to deliver that advice. ROSIE also benefits from machine learning. It's constantly interrogating the results of these efforts and optimizing both our messaging, as well as our channel delivery to drive the greatest outcomes for our customers and the highest revenue outcomes. Over the last year-and-a-half, we've driven roughly $18 million of incremental revenues through ROSIE and those results get stronger every day based on the machine learning. ROSIE's driving better and more timely leads and offers for us. It's increasing our sales and our revenues. By nature of the machine learning, it is a continuous improvement platform. And maybe most importantly, it's 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2019 FactSet CallStreet, LLC Regions Financial Corp. (RF) Corrected Transcript Investor Day 27-Feb-2019 prioritizing the best opportunities for our precious banker resources to reach out to our customers and make a difference in their financial outcomes. We've been transforming our retail network strategy actively over the last number of years, and we'll continue to do so. We're delivering a thin network by using customer and market analytics, and the thin network drives high visibility for us with less sites. It increases the size of our branch trade areas and it maximizes the reach of bankable population within those branch trade areas. It's allowing us to consolidate very effectively, retaining revenue and relationships, and grow efficiently in the growth markets that I mentioned earlier. Between 2014 and 2021, the end of this strategic planning cycle, we'll have reduced our branch count by 16%, while increasing the bankable households within our branch trade area by 10%. A great trade-off, more growth while doing so more efficiently. This gives you some of the pacing, we front-ended in the thin network strategy a lot of our consolidations. Over the last five years, we closed 284 branches. We'll continue to consolidate, and consolidations will outpace to de novos that we put into our growth markets, although the space between those numbers will start to narrow. And we'll also start to benefit from the revenue growth that we're getting from the de novo investments that we're making in these growth markets. The metrics tell the story here. As we've transformed the network, we've increased our revenue per branch, we've decreased our branch staff, and we're greatly increasing the population that we can reach in our branch trade areas. Probably the most important metric on this page is to look at the Consumer Bank efficiency ratio. This strategy has driven an improvement of 500 basis points over the last five years and we will deliver an additional 400 basis points of improvement over the next three years. This strategy plays out a little different depending on the market dynamics. I'll give you some examples. In St. Louis, we had roughly the right number of branches to cover that metro. Unfortunately, they weren't in the right places. Through a series of consolidations and de novos, we've repositioned where we were in that market. We actually shrunk by three branches, but we improved the growth dynamics of our branch trade area by 190%. In Houston, it's much more of a build-out. We had 25 sites in Houston; we're adding roughly 40 to that. We're going to increase within our branch trade area by 2.4 million individuals who we can now bank within that trade area. Atlanta is a little bit of both, some realignment as well as some growth. We'll be up net 24 sites by the time we're finished in Atlanta, will have increased almost 1 million individuals in our branch trade area. And in Orlando and Tampa, it's largely an optimization exercise, getting our branches and our sites in the right places. We'll actually be down in total across those two markets by 30 branches from start to finish, but will have increased the bankable individuals within our branch trade area by roughly a quarter of a million individuals. In every single one of these cases, we'll have improved the growth dynamics of our branch trade area. We'll improve the demographic profiles, improve the density and greatly improve the bankable households within our branch trade areas. And while we've been transforming our retail network, we've also been transforming our retail delivery model to make banking easier for our associates as well as our customers. I mentioned a little bit of how we're doing it for 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2019 FactSet CallStreet, LLC Regions Financial Corp. (RF) Corrected Transcript Investor Day 27-Feb-2019 customers. We're introducing them the 24x7 convenience and they're adopting it in great numbers allowing us to create efficiencies. But in addition to the migration we're seeing in simple transactions with our customers, we've also invested on digitizing and reducing operational tasks that were taking up the time and energy and resource of many of our associates. This has allowed us not only to get more efficient, but to go to one banker job family, certified bankers in our branches with continuous improvement path who can deliver more proactive guidance and more value to our customers. Over the last couple of years, we've reduced transaction-focused associates by more than 2,000 FTE, roughly 30%. And while doing so, we've increased our banker interactions by 20%, driving more opportunity while at the same time driving more efficiencies. We've used sophisticated staffing and scheduling models, and this January, we actually increased our Saturday hours by 60%. Saturdays are one of the most productive sales and revenue-generating days of the week that we operate in. We did this by not adding cost but by redistributing our scheduling and our plans for our branches during the week and we've been able to completely self-fund this. We're already seeing great increases in our net checking growth rates based on these Saturday hours and more banker interactions that we're delivering through an enhanced delivery model. We continue to invest in digital in everything that we do. As I'd mentioned, it's absolutely critical to our plans to add more value to our customers and focus on high-value interactions with them with certified bankers. Additionally, it allows us to deliver more innovative products and services to our customers. We're now doing instant issue debit and credit cards in our branches, have introduced digital payments. And from an account opening perspective in the digital environment, we are greatly improving the experience on both the deposit and the credit side, but especially on the credit side. John mentioned a number of the improvements from a standpoint of origination all the way through to booking for our customers and credit. We now have real-time pre-approved credit cards in the digital environment. We continue to make investments there to make it easier for our customers to expand their relationships with us. And last but not least, we're using the digital environment and technology to protect our customers. I mentioned earlier, our Regions LockIt Card Controls, allowing our customers to lock and unlock their cards, giving them an advanced level of protection in their payments versus our competitors. And we've also added real-time alerts to make our customers conscious of their payments that are going on. Now I'm going to talk about something that might seem a little contrary based on the way the industry's been going, but we are going to continue to grow our mortgage business. We have a strong operating advantage in the mortgage business that we're going to leverage. The mortgage transaction's still one of the most important transactions that any family in the United States enters into. It's a great relationship product. It's foundational to banking, and it's also a stable and high-performing asset on our balance sheet. But now I want to talk about our operating advantage. We're consistently rated in the top decile on customer service for both origination as well as servicing of mortgages. We have a direct origination model, as I mentioned earlier, not a correspondent model, driving roughly twice the risk adjusted returns versus correspondent mortgages. 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2019 FactSet CallStreet, LLC And we have an extreme advantage in our cost structure. Our origination and fulfillment costs are 44% less than the industry average to originate those loans and our servicing costs are 58% less than the industry average, strong cost advantages in this business that are going to allow us to grab share and continue to be profitable. And it's working. In 2018, through a difficult industry environment, the averages in the retail origination scorecard actually went into negative territory from a standpoint of returns. We stayed in positive territory through that difficult environment. We grew our purchase transactions by 7% in 2018. Our peers shrunk by 5%. And we increased and went up 10 places in mortgage volume during the 2018 year. The strategy is working for us. Some of the tactics that we're using is we are investing in mortgage loan originators in key markets and growth markets. But we're also aggressively investing in both capabilities and originators in our direct-to-consumer unit, which makes it very convenient for customers to get into the pipeline and then execute their mortgage. We pair that with strong digital investments. Over 50% of our mortgage applications are now done digitally by customers who are working with mortgage loan originators in the field as well as those who are coming in directly to us. This allows us to get these mortgages into the pipeline quicker, creates efficiencies in the back office and allows us to pull those mortgages through very efficiently and effectively. We're also using sophisticated data and analytics to identify customers within our base who may be in the market for a mortgage as well as prospects. We're stimulating that demand and we're driving them into the pipeline and pulling through those mortgages. And we are going to continue to grow our mortgage servicing business. As I mentioned before, it is an extremely efficient business for us. We have roughly $50 billion in balances today. And over the next three-year horizon, we'll grow our mortgage servicing business another $10 billion in balances, and we actually have capacity to go as high as $70 billion from the $60 billion that we'll grow to without any step function increases in our cost to service those mortgages, a strong competitive advantage. So to close, we're going to continue to focus on leveraging the superior customer service advantage we have with our customers and their brand loyalty as well as their primacy with our bank. We're going to invest in omni- channel to deliver the best experience that our customers can have while at the same time becoming more efficient. We're going to constantly use strong analytics to drive smart touches with our customers giving them the right information at the right time through the right channels. And we're going to use a strong operating advantage we have in the mortgage business to grow our share in that business and our contribution over time. Maybe the most important indicator to look to from the consumer bank is we're going to build on a 500-basis-point improvement in efficiency ratio over the last five years to have another 400-basis-point improvement in our efficiency ratio as we go forward through this strategic planning timeframe to 2021. With that, I'm going to close my remarks and I'm going to turn the podium over to my good friend and colleague, Bill Ritter of our Wealth Management Group. Thank you. Corrected Transcript Investor Day 27-Feb-2019 And thanks to everyone here today who's joined us to hear the Regions story. It's something we're proud of and excited to present to you. Before I get going on my prepared remarks about the Consumer Bank, we'll see just a brief video to share a little bit with you Regions brand of banking. This video gives you just a brief taste of how we're combining technology and proactive guidance to deliver better outcomes for our customers. It's allowing us to drive more value for them, grow our bank, while, at the same time, become more efficient every day. During my prepared comments today, you'll see a few themes emerge. One is how we're going to lean in to our superior customer service advantage, and the primacy and loyalty of our customer base. Secondly, how we're going to continue to invest in an omni-channel experience that delivers more value for our customers, while, at the same time, allowing us to become more efficient all the time. Third, we use strong data and analytics in everything that we do to target our customers appropriately, to deliver them the right solutions, as well as to prioritize our resources effectively. And fourth, we're going to lean in to a strong operating advantage we have in the mortgage business to grow our share in that business for the long term. Let's jump right in. Regions Consumer Bank drives roughly 58% of the revenue of Regions and about 53% of the pre-provision income. It's split between three businesses. Last year, the retail business delivered 86% of the pre-tax income of the Consumer Bank; mortgage, 12%; and our indirect business, 2%. We operate across 15 states, as was mentioned earlier, with roughly 1,450 branch sites. And we serve over 4.3 million consumer households and 370,000 small businesses. Let's take a quick look at the balance sheet. The Consumer Banking Group has roughly 61% of the deposits of the company. It's a deep and granular deposit base as mentioned already today. About a third of that is in noninterest-bearing accounts, and about half of it is in checking accounts. If we look at the other side of the balance sheet, we have $32 billion of loans, which is just a little shy of 40% of the loans of Regions. 44% of those are first mortgages and 70% are secured by real estate. 16% of our loans are in the indirect business, of which about 60% of those are secured by automobiles. The remainder is split between credit cards, direct loans to our consumers in our retail branches as well as small business loans in our retail branches. All of our product and business strategies are looked at through a lens of risk-adjusted returns and relationship opportunity, and we constantly look at the balance of our business and manage our concentrations. Some examples of that have been how we treated our indirect auto business. Few years ago, we exited a flow arrangement we had in indirect auto because the risk-adjusted returns were challenged when we put it into a runoff portfolio. And as John mentioned earlier today, the risk-adjusted returns on indirect auto business have been very challenged and really so optimal for us. So we are exiting that business with our last fundings occurring right around the end of the first quarter. Additionally, if you look at our mortgage business, we focus on direct origination, not correspondent lending. Direct-originated mortgages drive roughly twice the risk-adjusted returns of correspondent loans. If you look at our credit card portfolio, our relationship approach on credit card portfolio has allowed us to have 80% of our credit card holders actually have a deposit account with Regions as well, once again, driving stronger risk-adjusted returns and better performance through various credit cycles. 28 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2019 FactSet CallStreet, LLC Regions Financial Corp. (RF) Corrected Transcript Investor Day 27-Feb-2019 Last but not least, we focus on balanced business and managing our concentration limits. We've grown third-party unsecured loans pretty strongly the last couple of years. You will see that level out this year as we start to approach our concentration limits and keep our disciplines around that. Everything we do goes through a filter of risk-adjusted returns. It's so important that we get paid for the risk that we take. Let's talk a little bit about our Consumer Bank strengths. We talked a lot about our markets today. It's a nice combination. We have strong, dependable, and stable markets which give us great sources of income, but we also operate in some of the fastest-growing metros in the United States. As I mentioned earlier, we operate in 15 states. They hold about a third of the United States population. Our core markets reside in the states that you see on this slide in blue. And in those markets, we have some common characteristics across them: strong share, low-cost deposits, high primacy, and very granular loyal relationships. These markets represent between 85% and 87% of our loans, deposits and revenues in our retail bank. They're not only dependable; they're actually growing in a dependable fashion. Over the last three years, these markets have grown at a 3.5% compound annual growth rate in revenues and we can continue to see that happen as we go forward. Add to that the fact that we operate in 24 of the top 50 fastest-growing metros in the United States. These metros lie both within our core markets as well as in other markets that we operate in. You see some of the markets here where we're making investments and as mentioned earlier, in three of those – Atlanta, Houston, and Orlando – we'll be making investments across our lines of business with not only retail distribution investments and consumer investments, but investments in our resources in the Wealth Management area and in the Corporate Banking area. Additionally, we operate in other fast-growing metros where we're having nice growth rates, and we have future opportunities to make investments to accelerate those growth rates as well. Regions360 is our team-based, needs-based approach to bringing all of Regions to our customers every day. It's critically important that the Consumer Bank is especially good at this. We are the storefront for Regions. We really focus on it in two different ways. One of those is through proactive guidance with our certified bankers, which helps fill out all the core needs of our customers. That's really a penetration play that we can execute within our retail branches. But very importantly, when having the right needs-based discussions with skilled bankers, we uncover more complex needs, opportunities to introduce our partners in the Wealth Management area and in the Corporate Banking area to solve those complex needs for our customers. We've had strong results across both of these efforts. First of all, from a penetration perspective, we've increased Regions360 relationships in the Consumer Bank by 3.5% last year. And the Regions360 relationship is very simply a fully valued, fully sold relationship, which drives 140% more revenue than your average Consumer Banking relationship. Great progress on penetration. Additionally, though, we've done a really terrific job of introducing our experts in wealth and corporate to our customers to solve their more complex needs. During 2018, we drove over $170 million of incremental revenue from referrals. Additionally, 30% of all the mortgages that we originated last year were referred from our retail branches, and we introduced over 70,000 clients to our experts in the Wealth Management area for investment advice and investment products. 29 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2019 FactSet CallStreet, LLC Regions Financial Corp. (RF) Corrected Transcript Investor Day 27-Feb-2019 The hallmark of Regions is our relentless customer focus. I want to reward it with top-docile customer loyalty and very high brand favorability. 75% of our customers indicate that they'd be willing to refer friends and family. And in fact, in 2018, we opened up over 50,000 core checking relationships from referrals from our loyal customers. As John mentioned earlier, 60% of our deposits are held by customers who've been with our bank for over 10 years. And not only do we have loyal customers; we continue to grow. We've consolidated over the last five years 284 branches. In spite of that, we've grown consistently for six years straight and continue to have growth rates that per third-party conversations and relationships appear to be at the top of the industry. And it's not just working with core loyal customers; it's attracting the next generation of banking customers. 50% of our new checking account openings today are with customers under the age of 30. And you see a depiction on this slide of some of the card relationships we have through our Southeastern Conference affiliation being the bank of the Southeastern Conference, and we're fortunate to operate in all these market areas, attracting the next generation of banking customers. It's clearly a strength of ours when we get recognized by numerous third-parties. Here's just a few on this slide. But during 2018, no less than 12 third-parties recognized Regions as the number one or number two financial institution in customer experience, customer satisfaction and customer loyalty. This is clearly a competitive advantage for our bank. And what does it do for us? It drives industry leading primacy with our customers. Over 90% of our checking accounts are the primary checking account of our customers. Why is that important? It provides a stable, low-cost deposits. 92% of all the consumer deposits are held by customers who have their primary checking account with Regions. And we've had great performance across that base, and these primary accounts also have high activity levels with us, which drives noninterest revenues and makes us the first choice for their future financial needs. Our low-cost deposit base is probably the greatest financial contributor to Regions' overall financial results coming out of the Consumer Bank. As mentioned earlier, it's roughly 61% of our deposits. It's a very favorable mix with a lot of noninterest-bearing accounts, about roughly 33%, and we consistently have deposit costs at half our peer averages. And through these rising interest rates cycles, we've had one of the most, if not the best, low deposit beta as we've navigated through those interest rate increases. We have a strong relationship-focused card and payment offering. It's driven high activity and high growth levels. Our debit card portfolio has had the number one Visa power score for 17 straight quarters. The Visa power score takes penetration, activation and utilization to signify the highest-performing debit card portfolio in the industry, and I'd suggest the most profitable one. On the credit card side, we have outpaced industry growth in both spend and balances over the last three years with a compound annual growth rate of spend of 12% over that period and 9% on balances. We've also been an early adopter of payment innovations, wallets as well as real-time payments. And we've introduced proprietary products for our customers like our Regions LockIt card controls, which allow our customers to lock and unlock their card transactions in real time from their mobile device. Additionally, we recently rolled out a great rewards program for our credit card reward customers. Our Rewards Multiplier gives benefit for relationships and has our customers earning additional rewards and multiplying their 30 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2019 FactSet CallStreet, LLC Regions Financial Corp. (RF) Corrected Transcript Investor Day 27-Feb-2019 rewards based on their deposit relationships with the bank. Clearly, a great relationship product for us to continue to grow. Now, let's talk about how some of these strengths are going to play going forward as we continue to grow the Consumer Bank. First of all, we leverage data and analytics and all that we do. It's absolutely essential for us to understand our customers, understand their behaviors and their desires. This helps us drive our omni-channel approach, meeting our customers where they want to be met. Omni-channel allows us not only to add more value for our customers, but to do so more efficiently every day. We're utilizing geospatial analytics to drive our market strategies and our thin network strategy that allows us to consolidate effectively and grow efficiently in the growth markets that I mentioned earlier. And data and analytics are at the core of our proactive guidance, meeting our customers in every touch point with things like ROSIE that John mentioned earlier. We also are using advanced analytics to not only improve our credit experience, but also improve our credit decisioning and our credit outcomes as well as our ongoing credit monitoring to manage our risks. Our customers expect us to be excellent across all of our channels. We've successfully rolled out digital capabilities and automation that allows our customers to bank when and where they want. We've message to our customers and educated them on the convenience of 24/7 banking, especially for their simple transactions. We've seen extremely strong adoption. This is creating efficiencies for us. It's also allowing us to focus our bankers and our certified bankers on providing more proactive guidance and messaging to our customers, driving more value for them. 90% of all of our customer interactions today are automated or in the digital environment. But 60% of our customers still see value in visiting a branch and spending time getting guidance from our certified bankers. As mentioned earlier, 80% of our sales are generated from our branches and our certified bankers, even as we continue to grow our digital account openings at an aggressive rate. We're taking advantage of all the opportunities across this omni-channel experience. It's driving more customer value, driving more revenues, and it's doing so at lower cost. John mentioned ROSIE earlier. This is – we've operationalized a state-of-the-art system and platform to drive smart guidance to every touch point that we have with our customers. It's core to our strategy. ROSIE updates 350 different characteristics of customers and known prospects every single day. It then drives the next best action to improve the financial life of our customers to all of our touch points, where we can meet the customer as they come into us in a reactive nature with some good sound advice or we can reach out to them proactively to deliver that advice. ROSIE also benefits from machine learning. It's constantly interrogating the results of these efforts and optimizing both our messaging, as well as our channel delivery to drive the greatest outcomes for our customers and the highest revenue outcomes. Over the last year-and-a-half, we've driven roughly $18 million of incremental revenues through ROSIE and those results get stronger every day based on the machine learning. ROSIE's driving better and more timely leads and offers for us. It's increasing our sales and our revenues. By nature of the machine learning, it is a continuous improvement platform. And maybe most importantly, it's 31 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2019 FactSet CallStreet, LLC Regions Financial Corp. (RF) Corrected Transcript Investor Day 27-Feb-2019 prioritizing the best opportunities for our precious banker resources to reach out to our customers and make a difference in their financial outcomes. We've been transforming our retail network strategy actively over the last number of years, and we'll continue to do so. We're delivering a thin network by using customer and market analytics, and the thin network drives high visibility for us with less sites. It increases the size of our branch trade areas and it maximizes the reach of bankable population within those branch trade areas. It's allowing us to consolidate very effectively, retaining revenue and relationships, and grow efficiently in the growth markets that I mentioned earlier. Between 2014 and 2021, the end of this strategic planning cycle, we'll have reduced our branch count by 16%, while increasing the bankable households within our branch trade area by 10%. A great trade-off, more growth while doing so more efficiently. This gives you some of the pacing, we front-ended in the thin network strategy a lot of our consolidations. Over the last five years, we closed 284 branches. We'll continue to consolidate, and consolidations will outpace to de novos that we put into our growth markets, although the space between those numbers will start to narrow. And we'll also start to benefit from the revenue growth that we're getting from the de novo investments that we're making in these growth markets. The metrics tell the story here. As we've transformed the network, we've increased our revenue per branch, we've decreased our branch staff, and we're greatly increasing the population that we can reach in our branch trade areas. Probably the most important metric on this page is to look at the Consumer Bank efficiency ratio. This strategy has driven an improvement of 500 basis points over the last five years and we will deliver an additional 400 basis points of improvement over the next three years. This strategy plays out a little different depending on the market dynamics. I'll give you some examples. In St. Louis, we had roughly the right number of branches to cover that metro. Unfortunately, they weren't in the right places. Through a series of consolidations and de novos, we've repositioned where we were in that market. We actually shrunk by three branches, but we improved the growth dynamics of our branch trade area by 190%. In Houston, it's much more of a build-out. We had 25 sites in Houston; we're adding roughly 40 to that. We're going to increase within our branch trade area by 2.4 million individuals who we can now bank within that trade area. Atlanta is a little bit of both, some realignment as well as some growth. We'll be up net 24 sites by the time we're finished in Atlanta, will have increased almost 1 million individuals in our branch trade area. And in Orlando and Tampa, it's largely an optimization exercise, getting our branches and our sites in the right places. We'll actually be down in total across those two markets by 30 branches from start to finish, but will have increased the bankable individuals within our branch trade area by roughly a quarter of a million individuals. In every single one of these cases, we'll have improved the growth dynamics of our branch trade area. We'll improve the demographic profiles, improve the density and greatly improve the bankable households within our branch trade areas. And while we've been transforming our retail network, we've also been transforming our retail delivery model to make banking easier for our associates as well as our customers. I mentioned a little bit of how we're doing it for 32 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2019 FactSet CallStreet, LLC Regions Financial Corp. (RF) Corrected Transcript Investor Day 27-Feb-2019 customers. We're introducing them the 24x7 convenience and they're adopting it in great numbers allowing us to create efficiencies. But in addition to the migration we're seeing in simple transactions with our customers, we've also invested on digitizing and reducing operational tasks that were taking up the time and energy and resource of many of our associates. This has allowed us not only to get more efficient, but to go to one banker job family, certified bankers in our branches with continuous improvement path who can deliver more proactive guidance and more value to our customers. Over the last couple of years, we've reduced transaction-focused associates by more than 2,000 FTE, roughly 30%. And while doing so, we've increased our banker interactions by 20%, driving more opportunity while at the same time driving more efficiencies. We've used sophisticated staffing and scheduling models, and this January, we actually increased our Saturday hours by 60%. Saturdays are one of the most productive sales and revenue-generating days of the week that we operate in. We did this by not adding cost but by redistributing our scheduling and our plans for our branches during the week and we've been able to completely self-fund this. We're already seeing great increases in our net checking growth rates based on these Saturday hours and more banker interactions that we're delivering through an enhanced delivery model. We continue to invest in digital in everything that we do. As I'd mentioned, it's absolutely critical to our plans to add more value to our customers and focus on high-value interactions with them with certified bankers. Additionally, it allows us to deliver more innovative products and services to our customers. We're now doing instant issue debit and credit cards in our branches, have introduced digital payments. And from an account opening perspective in the digital environment, we are greatly improving the experience on both the deposit and the credit side, but especially on the credit side. John mentioned a number of the improvements from a standpoint of origination all the way through to booking for our customers and credit. We now have real-time pre-approved credit cards in the digital environment. We continue to make investments there to make it easier for our customers to expand their relationships with us. And last but not least, we're using the digital environment and technology to protect our customers. I mentioned earlier, our Regions LockIt Card Controls, allowing our customers to lock and unlock their cards, giving them an advanced level of protection in their payments versus our competitors. And we've also added real-time alerts to make our customers conscious of their payments that are going on. Now I'm going to talk about something that might seem a little contrary based on the way the industry's been going, but we are going to continue to grow our mortgage business. We have a strong operating advantage in the mortgage business that we're going to leverage. The mortgage transaction's still one of the most important transactions that any family in the United States enters into. It's a great relationship product. It's foundational to banking, and it's also a stable and high-performing asset on our balance sheet. But now I want to talk about our operating advantage. We're consistently rated in the top decile on customer service for both origination as well as servicing of mortgages. We have a direct origination model, as I mentioned earlier, not a correspondent model, driving roughly twice the risk adjusted returns versus correspondent mortgages. 33 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2019 FactSet CallStreet, LLC And we have an extreme advantage in our cost structure. Our origination and fulfillment costs are 44% less than the industry average to originate those loans and our servicing costs are 58% less than the industry average, strong cost advantages in this business that are going to allow us to grab share and continue to be profitable. And it's working. In 2018, through a difficult industry environment, the averages in the retail origination scorecard actually went into negative territory from a standpoint of returns. We stayed in positive territory through that difficult environment. We grew our purchase transactions by 7% in 2018. Our peers shrunk by 5%. And we increased and went up 10 places in mortgage volume during the 2018 year. The strategy is working for us. Some of the tactics that we're using is we are investing in mortgage loan originators in key markets and growth markets. But we're also aggressively investing in both capabilities and originators in our direct-to-consumer unit, which makes it very convenient for customers to get into the pipeline and then execute their mortgage. We pair that with strong digital investments. Over 50% of our mortgage applications are now done digitally by customers who are working with mortgage loan originators in the field as well as those who are coming in directly to us. This allows us to get these mortgages into the pipeline quicker, creates efficiencies in the back office and allows us to pull those mortgages through very efficiently and effectively. We're also using sophisticated data and analytics to identify customers within our base who may be in the market for a mortgage as well as prospects. We're stimulating that demand and we're driving them into the pipeline and pulling through those mortgages. And we are going to continue to grow our mortgage servicing business. As I mentioned before, it is an extremely efficient business for us. We have roughly $50 billion in balances today. And over the next three-year horizon, we'll grow our mortgage servicing business another $10 billion in balances, and we actually have capacity to go as high as $70 billion from the $60 billion that we'll grow to without any step function increases in our cost to service those mortgages, a strong competitive advantage. So to close, we're going to continue to focus on leveraging the superior customer service advantage we have with our customers and their brand loyalty as well as their primacy with our bank. We're going to invest in omni- channel to deliver the best experience that our customers can have while at the same time becoming more efficient. We're going to constantly use strong analytics to drive smart touches with our customers giving them the right information at the right time through the right channels. And we're going to use a strong operating advantage we have in the mortgage business to grow our share in that business and our contribution over time. Maybe the most important indicator to look to from the consumer bank is we're going to build on a 500-basis-point improvement in efficiency ratio over the last five years to have another 400-basis-point improvement in our efficiency ratio as we go forward through this strategic planning timeframe to 2021. With that, I'm going to close my remarks and I'm going to turn the podium over to my good friend and colleague, Bill Ritter of our Wealth Management Group. Thank you.",error,error,error,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_Investor-Day-2019-Transcript.pdf
unknown,"William D. Ritter Senior Executive VP & Head-Wealth Management Group, Regions Financial Corp. Good morning. I'm really excited to be with you this morning and really share the success that our Wealth teams had since we were last here together. I think we've made a lot of progress as a team. I think we're well-positioned for growth going forward and really have some true momentum as we head into this next strategic plan. 34 Regions Financial Corp. (RF) Corrected Transcript Investor Day 27-Feb-2019 So over the course of the presentation, I'll remind you briefly where we've been, talk a little bit about really what is Wealth at Regions and then talk about the opportunities we have in the next three years. But the key takeaways this morning, if you walk away with just three things, is that to profitably grow, we're going to leverage the uniqueness of our business model and the deep expertise of our wealth bankers. As John Turner touched on, we're going to utilize the partnerships we have within corporate and consumer to help deepen existing client relationships, bring in new ones and grow our markets. And then, finally, we've made some investments over the last three years, so we're going to focus on execution and really capitalize on the investments that we've made. So here's a quick overview of Wealth. It's roughly $0.5 billion in revenue, and we break it up into really a couple of different groups. One is our Private Wealth Group which handles the needs of affluent families and individuals. We have our Institutional Services team, which meets the wealth needs of corporations and endowments and foundations. It's supported by our Asset Management team. And then we have our Investment Group, which are 270 financial advisers that work in our branches with Scott Peters' consumer team. I will say we've operated for the last 100-plus years with a fiduciary standard of care. We think that's a strength for us and we're a little bit different than the rest of the bank in that the majority of our revenue is in the form of fee revenues you'll see on the slide. Results since our last Investor Day I think are strong. You look at non-interest income, which is up 19%, our profitability is up almost 50%, and our efficiency ratio has improved 430 basis points over the time period. So what's the Wealth business at Regions? You've seen a similar slide in the earlier presentations and we really look at our core markets as six markets, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, Tennessee and Florida. And 75% of the revenue comes from those three markets. And the growth opportunities are really around the edges, if you look at Texas, the Midwest, the Carolinas and Georgia. But I want to make sure you walk away with we've got growth opportunities in our core markets. Just a quick story. Earlier this year in a small town in Mississippi that I bet most people in this room has never visited, we had six clients in, and they each brought somebody with them who were not currently doing business with Regions. And these dozen people in this room had over $1 billion in assets and not all of it was with us. So if we have opportunities like that in this great small town in Mississippi, we have opportunities in Birmingham, Nashville, Mobile, Little Rock and other core markets to continue to grow. John Turner mentioned my backgrounds in consumer, so this slide looks a lot like Ronnie's. I'm a big believer in the relationship manager model. So in this example, the wealth advisor in private wealth serves as a quarterback of the relationship. They then build the appropriate team based on the client's needs. This could include someone in trust, a portfolio manager, somebody in wealth planning or someone from corporate banking or consumer banking to round out and meet all the needs of the customer. But we share the same passion for the client experience that both corporate and consumer do. And we've been recognized by our clients through Greenwich three years in a row as one of the top client experience wealth shops in the country. And our internal results last year were the best we've ever had. We take this kind of a one-team approach a little bit further, and on this slide you'll see four things that I think differentiate our wealth shop. And the first is one team and that's broadly one team it's what we call Regions360. And I think the best way to illustrate how this works is two quick stories. 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2019 FactSet CallStreet, LLC Regions Financial Corp. (RF) Corrected Transcript Investor Day 27-Feb-2019 The first is a customer of Scott's comes into the branch. They're a checking-only customer. They come in to cash a check. Scott's consumer banker meets their needs, cash the check, but over the course of the conversation learns that this customer is frustrated with their existing broker. Scott's team refers them to one of our financial advisors and we meet that need. But through the course of additional conversations, we uncover that this original checking-only customer had over $2 million scattered through different providers. And I'm happy to say now that this $2 million is with Regions. That's how Regions360 works. Similar story in Ronnie's business. Ronnie had a client. Again, his team was meeting all their needs from a traditional corporate banking standpoint. They had loans, treasury and were using Terry's capital markets capabilities, but they had never moved over their $0.25 billion investment account. They just felt the bank couldn't do that. They had it at a non-bank provider. Working with Ronnie's team and our team's expertise, late last year we were able to bring that $250 million to Regions, and again I think we have a much deeper relationship with that client. Second thing that I think differentiates us is our lower entry point. To be a client in private wealth, you have to have $0.5 million with Regions. We think that makes sense for the core markets that we operate in. We also think it gives us an opportunity with emerging wealth in some of the growth markets that we serve. This is working for us. If you look versus the peers that we were tracking, we're growing third fastest amongst peers. The other thing I'll point out that although our minimum is $500,000, the average account is approaching $1.3 million. The other strength for us is best thinking, and what I mean by that is we've put in place a consistent investment process and methodology that improves results and the experience for their client, but it also reduces risk for us. I simply mean that if a client with similar goals and similar risk tolerance in Indianapolis will have a similar portfolio to that with a customer in Miami. And then last but certainly not least, diversity, let me share with you a couple of facts. According to key research, 9 out of 10 women are expected to be the sole financial decision maker at some point in their lives. And furthermore, women are expected to inherit roughly 70% of the wealth that's going to be transferred in the next two generations. And so over the last three years, we wanted to position our team to more reflect what our customers are and what we'd like them to be. I'm also happy to report that not only are we attracting a more diverse workforce, they're very talented. We measure top performers as our top 10% and more than half of those are diverse leaders and bankers. As you can see from this slide, we offer a wide range of solutions for our clients. To the far left is our financial advisors. You can see that's growing almost 20% last year. Our high net worth space, you may be asking yourself in the high net worth space, if we have a lower entry point, how are we making money doing it? We benchmark with a third party and you can see that our operating margin is in the top quartile versus peers. We do that, one is we're not a low-cost provider. We think we provide good value and we ask for that for our clients. And second, we have a larger gearing ratio with our advisors than do many of our peers. And then if you look at from an institutional standpoint, we have some things that make us unique. We're the nation's largest funeral trust. We have the seventh largest corporate trust group. And we also have a natural resources and real estate group, which actually started with some of our institutional customers requesting more diversification. We manage land for trust, institutions and individuals, and we think that's a really valuable service for a bank to offer. 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2019 FactSet CallStreet, LLC Regions Financial Corp. (RF) Corrected Transcript Investor Day 27-Feb-2019 And we've been doing it for over 60 years. This group devotes itself to managing land assets, farmland, properties or timberland. It's a group I really like that these folks while we're sitting here wearing suits and ties, they're wearing jeans and boots out in the outdoors, really getting to understand our clients. And this could be something as simple as helping a family who had their grandfather's farm passed down and we manage it for the grandchildren, or it could be something as simple as talking with a private wealth prospect about their hunting land. Again, I think it's a real differentiator for us and it's something we have some size in. We manage over 200,000 acres of farmland, 1 million acres of timberland and 3 million acres of mineral rights. Let's move to the technology side. John Owen mentioned this. Happy to report we had a very successful conversion with our Regions Wealth Platform in late 2017. We converted 12 systems onto one to SEI's Wealth Platform. It was an improvement for the associate experience. It was an improvement for our client experience. It reduced our risk and it saved us money in the process. Something else we put in place in 2018 is what we call rTrac. It's simply an account aggregator. We think that this will allow us to better understand our clients' financial plans and it will also help us understand all the assets that the clients might not have at Regions. It's a cool tool where they can take a look at it either in a hard copy of a report or on their phone to see where all their assets are located and making sure that they're moving forward to hit their financial plans. Couple of things we're working on in this next strategic plan. We're working on an enhanced customer relationship management solution across Wealth. And [indiscernible] (02:19:45) as soon as we have this out for Wealth, I believe we'll be doing it in Mortgage as well. Again, I think it will be more efficient and allow our advisors to spend more time with their clients. And the other one on the left is you probably hear it as robo advice. This is something we're looking to put in place over the next couple of years. As you see, Scott Peters' team has attracted more younger clients, so we think that this will help their wealth needs there. And to hit again, we'll be hiring wealth bankers in Atlanta, Orlando and Houston. We got a little head start in Orlando and already have some good results. Again through our One Team Regions360 approach, we think it makes sense to do this as a team, and I really look forward to this being successful and John and us picking some additional markets to move to in the near future. So to close, for us to drive consistent sustainable long-term performance, we're going to do these three things: leverage the uniqueness of our business model, utilize partnerships, and focus on execution. And when we do this, we'll deliver 4% to 6% growth in noninterest revenue each of the years of the three-year plan and we'll improve the efficiency ratio by another 300 basis points, which will be roughly 700 basis points over the last six years. So with that, I'll stop. I think it's time for questions so, Ronnie and Scott, if you'd join me on stage. 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2019 FactSet CallStreet, LLC QUESTION AND ANSWER SECTION John Pancari Analyst, Evercore ISI Q Hi. Sorry. John Pancari, Evercore ISI. Just a question for Ronnie on the leverage lending exposure. In terms of that exposure, it looks like the portion of it is related to financial services companies within that. And just curious, does your overall lending exposure include exposure to or lines or loans to financial companies that re financing levered borrowers, or is that included somewhere else in your portfolio? Corrected Transcript Investor Day 27-Feb-2019 So over the course of the presentation, I'll remind you briefly where we've been, talk a little bit about really what is Wealth at Regions and then talk about the opportunities we have in the next three years. But the key takeaways this morning, if you walk away with just three things, is that to profitably grow, we're going to leverage the uniqueness of our business model and the deep expertise of our wealth bankers. As John Turner touched on, we're going to utilize the partnerships we have within corporate and consumer to help deepen existing client relationships, bring in new ones and grow our markets. And then, finally, we've made some investments over the last three years, so we're going to focus on execution and really capitalize on the investments that we've made. So here's a quick overview of Wealth. It's roughly $0.5 billion in revenue, and we break it up into really a couple of different groups. One is our Private Wealth Group which handles the needs of affluent families and individuals. We have our Institutional Services team, which meets the wealth needs of corporations and endowments and foundations. It's supported by our Asset Management team. And then we have our Investment Group, which are 270 financial advisers that work in our branches with Scott Peters' consumer team. I will say we've operated for the last 100-plus years with a fiduciary standard of care. We think that's a strength for us and we're a little bit different than the rest of the bank in that the majority of our revenue is in the form of fee revenues you'll see on the slide. Results since our last Investor Day I think are strong. You look at non-interest income, which is up 19%, our profitability is up almost 50%, and our efficiency ratio has improved 430 basis points over the time period. So what's the Wealth business at Regions? You've seen a similar slide in the earlier presentations and we really look at our core markets as six markets, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, Tennessee and Florida. And 75% of the revenue comes from those three markets. And the growth opportunities are really around the edges, if you look at Texas, the Midwest, the Carolinas and Georgia. But I want to make sure you walk away with we've got growth opportunities in our core markets. Just a quick story. Earlier this year in a small town in Mississippi that I bet most people in this room has never visited, we had six clients in, and they each brought somebody with them who were not currently doing business with Regions. And these dozen people in this room had over $1 billion in assets and not all of it was with us. So if we have opportunities like that in this great small town in Mississippi, we have opportunities in Birmingham, Nashville, Mobile, Little Rock and other core markets to continue to grow. John Turner mentioned my backgrounds in consumer, so this slide looks a lot like Ronnie's. I'm a big believer in the relationship manager model. So in this example, the wealth advisor in private wealth serves as a quarterback of the relationship. They then build the appropriate team based on the client's needs. This could include someone in trust, a portfolio manager, somebody in wealth planning or someone from corporate banking or consumer banking to round out and meet all the needs of the customer. But we share the same passion for the client experience that both corporate and consumer do. And we've been recognized by our clients through Greenwich three years in a row as one of the top client experience wealth shops in the country. And our internal results last year were the best we've ever had. We take this kind of a one-team approach a little bit further, and on this slide you'll see four things that I think differentiate our wealth shop. And the first is one team and that's broadly one team it's what we call Regions360. And I think the best way to illustrate how this works is two quick stories. 35 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2019 FactSet CallStreet, LLC Regions Financial Corp. (RF) Corrected Transcript Investor Day 27-Feb-2019 The first is a customer of Scott's comes into the branch. They're a checking-only customer. They come in to cash a check. Scott's consumer banker meets their needs, cash the check, but over the course of the conversation learns that this customer is frustrated with their existing broker. Scott's team refers them to one of our financial advisors and we meet that need. But through the course of additional conversations, we uncover that this original checking-only customer had over $2 million scattered through different providers. And I'm happy to say now that this $2 million is with Regions. That's how Regions360 works. Similar story in Ronnie's business. Ronnie had a client. Again, his team was meeting all their needs from a traditional corporate banking standpoint. They had loans, treasury and were using Terry's capital markets capabilities, but they had never moved over their $0.25 billion investment account. They just felt the bank couldn't do that. They had it at a non-bank provider. Working with Ronnie's team and our team's expertise, late last year we were able to bring that $250 million to Regions, and again I think we have a much deeper relationship with that client. Second thing that I think differentiates us is our lower entry point. To be a client in private wealth, you have to have $0.5 million with Regions. We think that makes sense for the core markets that we operate in. We also think it gives us an opportunity with emerging wealth in some of the growth markets that we serve. This is working for us. If you look versus the peers that we were tracking, we're growing third fastest amongst peers. The other thing I'll point out that although our minimum is $500,000, the average account is approaching $1.3 million. The other strength for us is best thinking, and what I mean by that is we've put in place a consistent investment process and methodology that improves results and the experience for their client, but it also reduces risk for us. I simply mean that if a client with similar goals and similar risk tolerance in Indianapolis will have a similar portfolio to that with a customer in Miami. And then last but certainly not least, diversity, let me share with you a couple of facts. According to key research, 9 out of 10 women are expected to be the sole financial decision maker at some point in their lives. And furthermore, women are expected to inherit roughly 70% of the wealth that's going to be transferred in the next two generations. And so over the last three years, we wanted to position our team to more reflect what our customers are and what we'd like them to be. I'm also happy to report that not only are we attracting a more diverse workforce, they're very talented. We measure top performers as our top 10% and more than half of those are diverse leaders and bankers. As you can see from this slide, we offer a wide range of solutions for our clients. To the far left is our financial advisors. You can see that's growing almost 20% last year. Our high net worth space, you may be asking yourself in the high net worth space, if we have a lower entry point, how are we making money doing it? We benchmark with a third party and you can see that our operating margin is in the top quartile versus peers. We do that, one is we're not a low-cost provider. We think we provide good value and we ask for that for our clients. And second, we have a larger gearing ratio with our advisors than do many of our peers. And then if you look at from an institutional standpoint, we have some things that make us unique. We're the nation's largest funeral trust. We have the seventh largest corporate trust group. And we also have a natural resources and real estate group, which actually started with some of our institutional customers requesting more diversification. We manage land for trust, institutions and individuals, and we think that's a really valuable service for a bank to offer. 36 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2019 FactSet CallStreet, LLC Regions Financial Corp.

answer,"We do have a limited amount of companies, but very limited within that leverage book that falls into our financial services area and through Regions Business Capital. We do have some exposure there, but very heavy asset- based reviewed and also has to meet that underwriting criteria. But it's not a meaningful number for us from an overall outstanding loans standpoint. But, yes, we do through Regions Business Capital and through our financial services area as well.",Ronald G.

question,"Okay. And then one follow-up is, can you just [ph] remind what is (02:22:55) the size of your total shared national credit portfolio if it all falls under you, and then also how much of that shared national credit portfolio would be considered leveraged in terms of credit? Thanks.",John Pancari,Analyst,Evercore ISI,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_Investor-Day-2019-Transcript.pdf
error,"A Yeah. So on the shared national credit portfolio, $20 million of loan balance is outstanding – $20 billion of loan balance is outstanding today.

question,"Hi. This is Chris Spahr with Wells Fargo. So can you expand a little bit on the thin branch strategy and what parts of technology in digital banking are you using to do that? And would you – and how does that relate to the consolidation like where we are in that process, how much it's [indiscernible] (02:23:44) will be consolidated? And then the last part is the 400 bps of efficiency improvement, can you break that down, like consolidation, technology savings and revenue initiatives? Thank you.",Christopher Spahr,Analyst,Wells Fargo Securities LLC,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_Investor-Day-2019-Transcript.pdf
unknown,"A Yeah, I'll do the best I can with all those. But the thin-network strategy, first to talk about technology. So we were actually very early on a bank in embracing front image capture. And what front image capture is essentially the ability for – in those days any way, tellers to do the transaction right on the counter and it to run straight through in a very efficient way using imaging capabilities. That front image capture capability has been extended to all of our bankers on their desks. So our bankers can actually take care of all noncash transactions with our customers. 38 That in combination with going to one bank or job family in our branches has allowed us to become incredibly efficient. So if you think about running any branch as a contained unit, having two job families in that branch makes it much less efficient where you have latency on one side or the other. By combining them together, we now have no latency in our branches and we've driven down our associate and banker costs while improving the capabilities of those bankers. Additionally, we've introduced video teller machines as well as have the most sophisticated ATMs, as well as in combination with all our digital capabilities and our mobile capabilities that we have for our customers. So those have been the big drivers kind of from a technology perspective as well as great customer adoption. So we focus our bankers on also being ambassadors for our digital environment. We have digital coaches who are signed in every one of our branches, and their job is to continually educate our customers on how to use those digital capabilities. From a standpoint of the efficiency ratio gains going forward, the 400 basis points, we don't really have it broken out specifically the way you said, but I will tell you we'll get material gains, one, from continued efficiencies of our staffing levels in our branches as we continue to involve the model and see migration go to our other channels. We'll also get benefits from now our de novo starting to take hold in our growth markets by adding additional revenues into the mix as well as consolidations. Over the next three-year timeframe right now in the plan, we have roughly 100 consolidations and roughly 75 de novo starts in our priority markets. But I would say that's a living strategy that we look at all the time based on customers' behaviors and market dynamics.",error,error,error,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_Investor-Day-2019-Transcript.pdf
question,"Hi. Stephen Scouten, Sandler O'Neill. I'm curious if you could talk about the health of the consumer and really what's leading you to push out of indirect auto and looks like push deeper into mortgage and how you think about those two within the context of the health of the consumer and then how you can grow that book overall with the headwind of indirect auto. Sounds like third-party relationships are kind of peaked out so how we can think about net growth there?",Stephen Kendall Scouten,Analyst,Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_Investor-Day-2019-Transcript.pdf
error,"A Yeah. I'd like to start with we don't want to grow just to grow. Our indirect auto business essentially we weren't making any money there. So we want to deploy our capital into things that are going to give us healthy returns, and this move out of indirect auto is going to allow us to put that capital to work in other products and businesses that make sense. From a standpoint – another element on indirect auto is it's not a very strong relationship product, doesn't provide a lot of opportunities for expanding those relationships. The mortgage product, on the other hand, is a relationship product where we get a lot of opportunity to grow the overall customer profitability with those assets, and it's a good strong performing asset on our balance sheet as well.",,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_Investor-Day-2019-Transcript.pdf
question,"Yeah, hi. Ryan Nash from Goldman Sachs. Ronnie, during your presentation, you talked about hedging services, capital raising and advisory service being the drivers of capital markets. And when I think back over the past few years, capital markets has been the main driver of fee income growth across the firm if you look over a three-year period. So, I guess the question is where are you in terms of the build out of capital markets or penetration across each of those three? And then, second, John had talked earlier about some potential for nonbank deals when I think you guys did for Sterling, BlackArch. What other capabilities could you look to add over time to continue to build out the capital market business?",Ryan M. Nash,Analyst,Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_Investor-Day-2019-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Sure. I'll lean back into Terry for the answer to the first part of that question, will come back to the bolt-on acquisitions, too, Ryan.",Ronald G. Smith,Senior Executive Vice President & Head of Corporate Banking Group,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_Investor-Day-2019-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Sure. Thanks. One of the areas we had on the slide here was asset securitization. That's an example where we've just started that business in early 2018, went through some hiring process, internal approvals. And we launched the product in the third quarter of 2018, starting to see customer adoption there, getting good traction. We're in the process of hiring additional talent for that business. So I think to your point, we're not going to see the kind of 29% CAGRs that we've seen in the past. But we do still see adoption by our clients really across our product set. I didn't mention this, but 2018 all of our lines of business were up. And so we're seeing better penetration and we're still introducing new products. So, again, not the 29% growth you've seen in the past, but the numbers are getting bigger and we still believe there's good healthy growth ahead.",Terry Katon,Executive Vice President & Head of Regions Bank Capital Markets,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_Investor-Day-2019-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah. Ryan, if I go back to other bolt-on acquisitions, we look at it a lot.

error,"John M. Turner, Jr. President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp. Yeah. Thank you. Great. Okay. I will introduce our final two presenters. First, is Barb Godin, who is our Deputy Chief Risk Officer and Chief Credit Officer. Barb has over 45 years of experience in the financial services industry. Previously prior to joining Regions in 2003, Barb worked for Scotiabank and KeyBank, much for experience has been around lending and credit activities. Barb was named our Chief Credit Officer in 2010 and working closely with Matt Lusco and others. Many of you know that Barb has been providing great leadership, helping us continue to build out a really sound risk culture that we think is going to produce consistent and sustainable results over time. Our other presenter is David Turner, our Chief Financial Officer. Prior to joining Regions in 2006 David began his career in public accounting working for both Arthur Andersen and KPMG, and I guess it's somewhat ironic. David was also made Chief Financial Officer in 2010. So he and Barb got their positions at particularly challenging times in the industry and for Regions. So we're happy to have both of them sort of close the day for us, as they provide a great leadership in helping us build the bank that we have become and putting us in a position to deliver really consistent sustainable results.

unknown,"Barbara I. Godin Senior Executive Vice President, Deputy Chief Risk Officer & Chief Credit Officer, Regions Financial Corp. Thanks very much, John, and welcome everyone. Glad you're here today. I am absolutely thrilled for what, you need to know, is to be able to speak to you on the great progress that we've made on our journey on credit risk management. I want to talk to you about the three takeaways that we have. But generally we are focused on continuous improvement in credit risk management and we are driving for excellence. Simply said, we are upping our game every single day. We significantly enhanced our risk infrastructure be it on people, on processes, on data, around analytics. And we've created a much more integrated and holistic risk management framework, as well we've upgraded our talent. Just since 2015, we've upgraded almost 20% of our senior credit team, with many of the new hires coming in from money center banks as well as from several across the broader financial industry. We believe that understanding credit risk and providing a holistic risk management framework is absolutely paramount to what we do. As you can see on the slide we've established various risk pillars, within this framework that combine robust data, analytics along with human subject matter experts to support it. Now the pillars here show how we're organized, and I'll talk a little more about these pillars and how the comprehensive changes we've made at risk management over the past several years have really enhanced our overall risk profile. We manage credit risk with a collaborative approach that aligns people, processes, data, and analytics and provides better consistency of outcome. As an example, our credit portfolio management team is really closely collaborating with our risk analytics team, and all of the other data scientists we have across the bank and they 42 Regions Financial Corp. (RF) Corrected Transcript Investor Day 27-Feb-2019 stress test our portfolios using a multiplicity of different scenarios. We also have a geospatial team and they provide us with proactive identification of credit risks in the event of a potential extreme weather event or any other catastrophic event. All of this allows us to fine tune both our concentration limit framework, as well as our portfolio shaping strategies. Now this coupled with a capital commitment working group that Ronnie Smith spoke to you about, all of this is incorporated into our strategic planning process. Our integrated credit risk framework that you see here is core to how we manage credit risks and it's led us to greater risk intelligence. We know that neglect of any one area can lead to less than optimal results. We certainly saw that in the last recession. With this in mind we built and we evolved an integrated framework that we believe holistically addresses risk and reward and proactively helps us to not only understand risk but also to manage and to mitigate that risk. As you've already heard from our three business leaders, that's Ronnie, Scott and Bill, one major facet of our framework is concentration limit management. Under industry concentrations, you can see the number and the level and the limits we have in place. Now we slice this in a lot of different ways. We have limits on industry, geography, product, as well as on single-name concentrations. We disaggregate. We manage these limits at a very detailed level within our businesses but then as well we also aggregate them at the top of the company and manage them there. [indiscernible] (02:37:55) for each dimension very carefully and we try to gather the limits and our risk appetite, as well as our capital, our emerging risks, our product expertise and our market performance. Most importantly, we abide by these limits. Signals from this framework have resulted in us doing active portfolio shaping in energy, education, healthcare, multifamily and this has resulted in some portfolio reduction in some of the sub-asset classes as we've done a remix there. Here's a great example of concentration limit management. A multifamily was strategically de-risked from 2010 to 2012, as we focused on decreasing our investor real estate concentration. Then we saw growth that began to occur in the 2013 and 2014 timeframe. But as we assessed the oversupply in certain urban core markets, we pivoted and we imposed tighter limits and tighter construction underwriting parameters in any markets of concern. Today, our multifamily portfolio exhibits really strong asset quality metrics and that's due to our focus on high quality developed to own relationships, and average upfront equity contributions have really held up this cycle, lending strength on a project by project basis and providing us a lot of comfort around this portfolio. So clearly, however, this framework impacted loan growth, but it was the appropriate course of action for our risk profile. The concentration limits we have in place today have led to a very diversified book. Our wholesale book, as you can see here stands at almost $52 billion, with our largest segment being other which is really just a compilation of a lot of different products. On the consumers side, residential mortgage and home equity make up the majority of the book, and I'll talk about both of them a little later on. What you can see however is that our overall wholesale book is pretty granular with a focus on client selection. Our consumer book is high quality, and here, as in our wholesale book, we focus on risk adjusted returns. Another example of our integrated framework is in our expansion of our portfolio warning indicators. Now pre-crisis we track, we monitor a lot of portfolio metrics. But it was really clear to us that even more granularity was necessary. So as such, we worked with our in-house data scientists and we set additional top of the company business unit product and sub product limits. And today, we have well over 100 of them in place. These indicators have provided us with deep insights on portfolio attributes, as well as providing predictive insights through the use of both internal data, as well as external macroeconomic and industry-specific metrics. 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2019 FactSet CallStreet, LLC Regions Financial Corp. (RF) Corrected Transcript Investor Day 27-Feb-2019 So I've talked a lot about our early warning indicators and our concentration limit management. And that's because it's absolutely core to strong credit risk management, and it's something that we spent a lot of time reviewing and managing really closely. We deploy our capital based on a comprehensive evaluation of credit risk across several different measures. We assign portfolio values, that's both adds as well as deducts based on things like utilization, expected loss, and economic capital. And we focus on relationships where we have both the expertise and capabilities and where the return exceeds the risk which is in line by the way with our overall strategy. We also have a comprehensive set of tools to support our credit risk appetite and that's intimately linked to our strategic plan. Said another way, credit risk has a place at the strategic planning table. It's informed by a combination of risk and reward, as well as by portfolio performance and enhanced by our loss mitigation strategies. Further, our early warning indicators help us to address any emerging risks that we see. This linked approach helps make us much more risk intelligent. Now, let me spend a few minutes discussing how we have transitioned our culture to drive active portfolio management. Let me start with how we're doing this on a handful of credit portfolios that are currently top of mind and certainly, top of mind for the industry at large. As Ronnie noted, leveraged lending, it's a portfolio we spend a lot of time on and one that we monitor really, really closely. Now, there's a myriad of ways to look at what a leveraged loan is, as there is no real commonality in the industry. We use a definition of three times senior debt or four times total committed debt, and we don't require that a loan meet a purpose test, such as an acquisition or capital distribution to be called leveraged. We also include all investment grade credits and based on our definition, we manage about $5.5 billion of loans and leveraged book. However, Moody's recently conducted a study on leveraged loans and based on the definition that they used in an industry report they say we have about $3 billion of leveraged loans. Notwithstanding, if it's $3 billion or $5 billion or it's something in between, our leveraged loans are reserved for our high quality C&I customers. And where we have sponsors, we underwrite both the sponsor, as well as the client. We also centrally underwrite these credits, and we have a dedicated team that does that. We closely monitor the book with strict policies including the maximum size that we let this portfolio get to. As well, we have limited participation in the [ph] highest respect (02:44:08) segments of leveraged loans. That being covenant lite and Term Loan Bs. More importantly, and most importantly, it's simply not a strategic growth objective for us. Last Investor Day when we were here, we discussed energy and what we thought the losses might be given the collapse in the price of a barrel of oil. I'm happy to say the losses we experienced were well in line and they were within our expectations. We believe our results demonstrate our sound underwriting discipline, our limited risk appetite, our active portfolio management, and our concentration limit management. As John Turner indicated a little earlier, we're the largest bank in the Gulf South and nonetheless we abided by our limits and we didn't have an outsized portfolio. Within our energy group, we manage the book with an experienced team of in-house engineers, geologists, relationship managers, and credit specialists. And we also understand the cyclicality of this business and have a really long track record in the industry. We've been in it for over 50 years, by the way. We've also remixed our book, and we have a focus in the past several years on the lower risk upstream and mid-stream segments. 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2019 FactSet CallStreet, LLC Regions Financial Corp. (RF) Corrected Transcript Investor Day 27-Feb-2019 As previously mentioned, we went through an extended period of de-risking to establish a very solid investor real estate portfolio. We are now growing this book, but we're doing it in a very thoughtful and a very prudent fashion. Further, we've refocused this business on owner investors, as well as term lending versus construction. As you can see on the slide, equity continues to be a critical and a required – it's a required component of underwriting. And here we focus on the upper end of the market, as well as on well-capitalized clients. So let's talk about consumer for a minute. Our consumer real estate focus is a really high quality book, and it's underscored and you can see here by our FICO scores, as well as our loan-to-values. Our residential mortgage book, it's a super prime book and we don't originate subprime loans. Now for that matter, we don't originate subprime loans in our home equity book either. On our home equity lines, we have a maximum loan-to-value of 80% and we don't offer an interest-only option. Additionally, we know there's been some concern about reset risk. Our home equity book has less than 10% of our loans resetting over the next three years. And what we do is we contact our customers six months in advance of their reset date, to make sure they're not going to have a problem with the payment. Lastly, our consumer unsecured book totals approximately $4 billion, and it's tightly managed and underwritten by dedicated teams. You can see the metrics summarizing these portfolios as well as a couple of points on how we manage the risks. For credit cards, it's comprised of prime loans where we have a focus on extending offers to existing customers, in our third-party lending portfolio, we have several loss sharing agreements in place and that really helps us to mitigate the risk. And for the consumer unsecured book, this is a high quality portfolio and it's offered in our digital channel, as well as in our branches. In fact in our overall unsecured book, everything here, it's comprised of over 85% who are homeowners. I would like to finish with a few points on credit that are clearly part of who we now are. We have a strong credit risk culture, and we understand that credit is about consistently and constantly paying attention to and managing the details. Our goal is to produce positive, sustainable and consistent credit outcomes, risk is top of mind for all the associates and we form business risk committees and they're chaired by the head of the line of business, as well as by risk. And we identify, manage, monitor, mitigate, and report on both existing, as well as on emerging risks. At our last Investor Day, I told you about the great progress we made as it relates to risk and we're building on it every day. But we do acknowledge that we had some historical credit issues last cycle, that led to a number of process, policy, and, yes, even people changes. However we are laser-focused on making sure that never happens again. Our portfolio is diversified and our performance reflects this, as well as demonstrating all of significant improvements we have made in our risk profile. Our underwriting, as I said, is consistent and it's disciplined. And we focus on industry and geographic concentrations, as well as all of the associated risk adjusted returns. As we turn to client selection, we know one thing. It always starts with client selection. You simply can't underwrite and structure a weak client. We have specialized teams in place, including underwriters, relationship managers, and credit specialists. And they all have deep expertise in their specific industries and they all spend their time understanding our client's needs, their cash flows, their companies, and the industries they're in. We make analytically informed decisions and we are continuing to invest in our analytical infrastructure. We also stress test our loans and that's to ensure we understand the risk and we understand the reward and we price for that risk. 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2019 FactSet CallStreet, LLC We also manage through the cycle which means we underwrite based on the view and make sure our loans perform today as well as in a more challenging economic environment. That's because we want to create a portfolio that has low variability to it. So to summarize, we have a strong and resilient credit risk infrastructure. This enables us to better anticipate and to be proactive with both current as well as potential future credit concerns. That's because we made strategic investments in our people, our processes, data infrastructure, and in our analytical capabilities. And we understand that every associate in the company is a risk manager. It's part of who we are today. It's also why we feel comfortable with our three year view [ph] on loss (02:51:13) staying within a 40 to 65 basis point range. And please recognize that these estimates include the potential impact of an economic downturn during this time. So with that, I'd like to turn it over to David. Corrected Transcript Investor Day 27-Feb-2019 stress test our portfolios using a multiplicity of different scenarios. We also have a geospatial team and they provide us with proactive identification of credit risks in the event of a potential extreme weather event or any other catastrophic event. All of this allows us to fine tune both our concentration limit framework, as well as our portfolio shaping strategies. Now this coupled with a capital commitment working group that Ronnie Smith spoke to you about, all of this is incorporated into our strategic planning process. Our integrated credit risk framework that you see here is core to how we manage credit risks and it's led us to greater risk intelligence. We know that neglect of any one area can lead to less than optimal results. We certainly saw that in the last recession. With this in mind we built and we evolved an integrated framework that we believe holistically addresses risk and reward and proactively helps us to not only understand risk but also to manage and to mitigate that risk. As you've already heard from our three business leaders, that's Ronnie, Scott and Bill, one major facet of our framework is concentration limit management. Under industry concentrations, you can see the number and the level and the limits we have in place. Now we slice this in a lot of different ways. We have limits on industry, geography, product, as well as on single-name concentrations. We disaggregate. We manage these limits at a very detailed level within our businesses but then as well we also aggregate them at the top of the company and manage them there. [indiscernible] (02:37:55) for each dimension very carefully and we try to gather the limits and our risk appetite, as well as our capital, our emerging risks, our product expertise and our market performance. Most importantly, we abide by these limits.

unknown,"David J. Turner, Jr. Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer, Regions Financial Corp. Okay. Thank you, Barb. Good to be with you today. And what I'll try to do is wrap it up and show you when we pull all this together what it looks like from a financial perspective. Generating a consistent long-term performance has been what we've been about for a long time. And we think we put together a good strategic plan for you over the next three years. You've heard from John and our business leaders on their very specific strategies that we're putting in place to give the kind of returns back to our shareholders. And so I'm going to pull that together financially and then I also want to talk about how we're going to manage interest rate risk over this next three year period of time given that we have a little uncertainty with regards to fed policy and the economy. There are five things I want you to take away from the financial presentation today along with the numbers at the very end. We spend a lot of time on focusing on risk adjusted returns. We are not in the business of having nominal growth in the balance sheet whether that be from loans or deposits. We are not in the business of growing nominal revenue. And we're not in the business of growing nominal net income. It's about the right kind of growth with the right return characteristics. And if we stay focused on that we might not grow as fast as others but we will give our shareholders an enhanced return on their investment. Critically important to us. We're in great markets. We have a competitive advantage in our deposit franchise. It has been a competitive advantage for us for a number of years. We just started to see the benefits of that starting in about the end of 2016, as rates began to increase and we could extract the value out of our deposit franchise. It not only provides great liquidity for us but it provides great profitability for us as well. As I mentioned, interest rate risk management is going to be critical for us to manage over the next three years. We have a very solid asset liability management committee and I'll talk a little bit about what that looks like in a bit. We have had very robust capital position, very strong, we have a little bit of excess still. We're working towards getting that down to our optimum level this summer but we also generate a lot of capital. And as John mentioned to you earlier, we're about organic growth. We want to reinvest our capital generation back into the business. We want to have a nice dividend, but we also have capital that provides some flexibility to us. But if we can't deploy it, we're going to give it back to the shareholders in the form of share repurchases. We're going to talk about that in a bit. And then finally, when credit normalizes, we don't have lift from interest rates. We kind of optimize our capital. The question is what do you do from here? How do you continue to grow appropriately and provide the kind of returns that our shareholders expect? Simplify and Grow is the mechanism that we will have that we started in the latter part of 2017. And we'll show you – you've seen a little bit of that already from John Owen but it's really important 46 Regions Financial Corp. (RF) Corrected Transcript Investor Day 27-Feb-2019 to us going forward. Now three years ago, [ph] it was (02:55:02) November 2015 we're in this very room where we laid out our three year strategic plan for you. And I'm happy John showed this to you in terms of meeting and achieving all three of these risk adjusted return of 16.5%. It's on an adjusted basis, efficiency of 59.3% and you can see earnings per share growth of some 24%. The carve-out [ph] NIM (02:55:30) – the favorable impact of tax reform is 19%. Nonetheless we met the targets that we laid out at Investor Day. And we're very happy to report on that. So how we do that? We stayed focused on three strategic pillars, growing and diversifying revenue, managing our expense base and deploying our capital appropriately. So on growing and diversifying revenue, clearly leveraging our competitive advantage on deposits in a rising rate environment was a key driver, continuing to make investments in people, businesses, products, to grow revenue and as you can see over the three years, we grew revenue some 12%. We're very happy with that. We're in a very competitive business, commodity business. We differentiate ourselves on service, if you haven't picked that up from today. In a commodity business you better become really efficient. And we're happy that we've worked on this growing revenue but also watching our expense base and improved our efficiency some 480 basis points to 59.3%. But that's not good enough. We're not finished there and I'll show you what that looks like. We have to control head count, we have to control square footage if we're going to attack efficiency and we did that and we'll do it going forward. From a capital standpoint again, not growing for growth's sake, growing because it's the right thing to do with the right return profile, allowed us to free up capital, to divest the businesses and products that weren't giving us kind of return we wanted and redeploying that or giving it back to our shareholders. Evidence of that is in 2018, we returned some 154% of the capital we've generated back to our shareholders in the form of a dividend or share repurchase. So staying focused here is what allows us to give you the return that you expect. Now we have to go back three years and times are uncertain in terms of what might happen for three years. As you can see here, if you look at 2018 on the right hand side of the slide, you can see the 10 year finished about where we thought it would finish. But along the way, you can see the rate environment wasn't quite what we anticipated and therefore we had to adapt and overcome. We had the talk we want to do something different. So what did we do? A number of things, but a couple of them I point out. We had a $300 million expense program that we had established and that wasn't good enough. We went back to the well, and we added a $100 million to that program to have a $400 million expense program which got us to the end of 2016 when the rate environment finally started to increase. We could begin to extract the value out of our deposit base and grow net interest income and the resulting margin. The point of this slide is not just that we got to the three year targets that we laid out at Investor Day, that's important and we're glad we did that. But three years is a long time and we don't know exactly what will happen, but what we're telling you is we're going to make a commitment for these three years and we're going to get there. We may have to do it differently than we think today, but we'll toggle, we'll adapt, and we'll overcome. So we're excited about the plan that we're going to put forth. So let me transition into the next three years and tell you a little bit about how we're going to manage a key component of our income statement, which is net interest income. Net interest income as you know represent 65% of our revenue. Therefore we better be very good at managing our interest rate risk. As we think about our outperformance and net interest margin over the past three years, the driver of that is the core deposit franchise you've heard about numerous times today. It will be a key component, a key driver of our NIM outperformance for the next three years as well. 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2019 FactSet CallStreet, LLC Regions Financial Corp. (RF) Corrected Transcript Investor Day 27-Feb-2019 As we thought about how we manage interest rate risk, we went into this environment with the expectation that we're going to have growth in the economy. And as a result of that growth in the economy that interest rates would begin to rise and we would start to see the value of our deposit franchise, which we have talked about forever being our competitive advantage. You just couldn't see it because the rate environment was so low. So we were able to do that and you can see our outperformance in margin. As we think about the next three years, we have to think about how we're going to manage that interest rate risk, given the fact that the economy might be slowing. So for us, over the next three years, we have GDP this year of about 2.5%. We think we'll grow at about 2% in 2020 about 1% in 2021. Those are in the back in the appendix if you haven't already seen them. That's our base case. So we are not forecasting a recession, but we are forecasting a slower growth environment. Therefore, as that begins to happen, the risk of having rate cuts or rate reductions becomes more important to manage for us. Therefore, we're doing two key things: one, continuing to focus on risk-adjusted returns. We're not going to grow nominally. We're going to grow when we get paid for the risk appropriately. The other is beginning to enter into our hedging strategy using forward-starting derivatives, primarily interest rate swaps but some floors. Those forward-starting swaps and floors really begin in 2020. And the reason we did that is because we wanted to be able to preserve the ability to extract more value as the possibility of rates were going to increase here in the near term. Now, as of late, we're in perhaps a flat rate environment going from here. I'm going to talk about that in just a minute what it might mean to us. So we want to protect our competitive advantage called our deposit costs. So we have a very strong balance sheet. It's prepared for an evolving environment. It's a very simple balance sheet. On the loan side, on earning assets, 75% are loans. If you factor in hedging, we're about 50% fixed and 50% variable. If you look at the liability side of the balance sheet, 85% of our liabilities are deposits. That's the competitive advantage that we see. That large deposit base really adds to our sensitivity. If you look at how we've been able to leverage the deposit base, you can see our beta and this is our overall funding beta, which we believe is more relevant today. It's been 22% cycle today. Now we believe, based on our expectations, that that beta will be somewhere between 30% and 40% when we get to the end of the cycle. Now even in a flat rate environment, we do have some sensitivity that will be coming through in the form of repricing of loans and reinvestment of our maturing securities, some $13 billion over the next 12 months; as you can see, nine of that in the form of loans and four of that in the form of securities. So we believe we're going to continue to be able to grow net interest income and the resulting margin even in that environment. So here again, our solid deposit advantage and you heard Scott Peters talk about this earlier. Of our deposits, two-thirds of those are retail deposits. When we say the word retail, we're talking about consumer deposits and wealth deposits. Of the consumer deposits, 60% of those are from customers that have been banking with us for over 10 years, very loyal, very sticky, price insensitive deposits. You couple that with where they're located and the fact that we continue to grow what's core to our franchise and that is the consumer checking account and the business operating account. That's what our teams go to market. They think about the right side of the balance sheet first than the left side of the balance sheet. And it has served us well thus far. We think it will serve us well over the next three years. So it's how do we grow those core relationships. 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2019 FactSet CallStreet, LLC Regions Financial Corp. (RF) Corrected Transcript Investor Day 27-Feb-2019 As Ronnie mentioned, I thought it was a great analogy. Every one of his business customers has a deposit relationship but not everybody needs a loan. And so we want to make sure we capture those [ph] two (03:04:55) deposit relationships. We're in very strong markets. We are the strength in 70% of our markets. We are the money center bank. And as a result, we've been able to position ourselves to capture higher growth percentage than might be happening in that market because of our dominance. Now, there's another side of this sword and that is if you look at our deposit cost at 34 basis points that compares to peers at 64 basis points. This is the fourth quarter. So as you think about the environment that we're going to be potentially going through, if our deposit costs are here and our peers are here, win rates perhaps go the other way. They have a mechanism of being able to protect their net interest income and their margin by reducing deposit costs whereas we don't have that. Therefore, it's incumbent upon us to start entering into hedging relationships to help protect our net interest income and margin. And that's why we've started to enter into these forward-starting swaps that we began in 2020. You know we have a very strong liquidity position, again provided by this good core deposit base. You can see our loan/deposit ratio of some 88% right there in the middle of the peer group. But what's important on this slide is the right side and that is the level of wholesale or unsecured debt to total assets being half of our peers. What that does is it provides flexibility for us to be able to manage the deposit side. It gives us diversity of funding. So to the extent that we needed to draw down on wholesale funding, we have that capacity to do that to make whatever investments we need to make. As a matter of fact, you saw us do that in the latter part of 2018 where we took down an unsecured bank debt instrument. We paid up for that relative to a deposit. But what we did is we had savings in FDIC expense. So from an income statement standpoint, it was a push, but we freed up a lot of liquidity. So when we have those opportunities, that's what we're going to do. So we're in very good shape here from a funding standpoint, a lot of flexibility. You heard John Turner talk earlier about our ability to gather deposits. We're good at that. So we feel very good about our liquidity position. We do have potential benefits from LCR to the extent that we can reposition some high quality liquid assets. Ginnie Mae securities would be an example where if LCR went away, perhaps we could redeploy those in higher earning securities. We also had some deposits that we ended up having to price at a level that was inconsistent with the customer's expectation. So they would move those deposits to banks that weren't subject to LCR that maybe we could get those back in time. So let me talk about our margin expectation over the next three years. The goal is to try and drive out the variability of our margin. If you look at this slide, we believe we can operate somewhere between 3.4% and 3.7% on net interest margin over the next three years. As you think about – let me tell you what that's predicated on, on the upper range of 3.7%, we would experience modest GDP growth, we would have a stable credit environment and as a result, the expectation would be another two, maybe three tightenings over the three year cycle, such that Fed funds would approach 3% as well as the 10-year Treasury. That's also predicated on the balance sheet growth that I'll talk about in just a minute. The lower end would come about to the extent we had a recession similar to the post-World War II recessions that we've had in the past, excluding the Great Recession. There, Fed policy reverts to near zero and the 10-year declines is something that we haven't seen many times of 1.5% or below. So it's important that we take that 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2019 FactSet CallStreet, LLC Regions Financial Corp. (RF) Corrected Transcript Investor Day 27-Feb-2019 variability out. You can run those through your models. Today, we're at 3.55% and so a question may be what happens if we're where we are right now and just kind of stay flat for an extended period of time. Now we believe we have some asset sensitivity that will push through, as I just mentioned on repricing and reinvestment of the securities book. So we think we can continue to grow our net interest income and margin. The bigger driver of that will be earning asset growth versus carry coming through from a rate standpoint. So we think we're well-positioned in any plausible environment that we may get over the next three years and are excited about being able to drive out that variability. So we've had to make some pretty challenging decisions over the last three years and we will continue to challenge ourselves going forward because our business needs to continue to focus on risk-adjusted returns. I won't go through all of these but a couple of those Scott mentioned earlier. We didn't renew a third-party contract from a floor arrangement we had on indirect auto because the returns were unacceptable. Now, we just decided to discontinue our indirect auto originations because the returns are unacceptable. We will be in the direct auto business but not the indirect. We sold Regions Insurance Group again because the return for us was unacceptable. And we didn't see a path to being able to get these businesses to the kind of return that we really wanted to have nor were these businesses particularly synergistic. You don't have to have every product giving you [indiscernible] (03:11:24) in return if there's synergy involved. Here, these were one-off transactions, which is why we sold. What that allowed us to do is to make critical investments into our business where we do have a competitive advantage. Mortgage servicing rights, we bought almost $16 billion of mortgage servicing rights over the last three years because we're good at it. We're a low cost operator and we have excess capacity still in our mortgage servicing operation, so you should see us continue to make investments to grow there. We've been able to invest in talent and technology, talent in the case of corporate and commercial RMs, wealth advisors, mortgage loan originators. So we've been able to take opportunities, cut cost, which generates the ability for us to reinvest back into our business. From a capital standpoint, we have a very robust capital planning process. We're very proud of our capital planning process. It integrates risk management and strategic planning in it. The result originally was this submission called CCAR that we've had. We're one of the very few banks that never received an objection to a CCAR submission, very proud of that. It's what gave us and gives us the confidence that our capital planning process is sufficiently robust. It's also provided us the confidence of being able to return $5.4 billion to our shareholders over the past three years, a tremendous amount of capital for a company our size, while maintaining a very solid capital level. As we think about positioning our capital stack, we've talked to – this is not news to any of you, but our common equity Tier 1 goal target is 9.5%. That's derived mathematically. We start with our post stress limit of 7%, and why that's important is we want to have capital that can sustain [ph] whatever (03:13:37) environment we may have, so we can sustain our dividend. We don't want to have to cut our dividend like our industry did in the past. From that, we add 2% for our quantitative buffer based on the risk profile that we have at Regions. And on top of that, we add 50 basis points for our management cushion. So as we think about a lot of different constituents – obviously investors, rating agencies – we want to make sure that we're considering all aspects of the expectations there so that we can have a robust capital framework. We want not to have too much capital because it hurts our return. We can't have too little capital and not get the ratings upgrade that we're still looking for and expect over 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2019 FactSet CallStreet, LLC Regions Financial Corp. (RF) Corrected Transcript Investor Day 27-Feb-2019 time. So having this amount of capital provides that flexibility while returning appropriate returns to our shareholders. Let me talk a little bit about how we think about capital allocation. This slide shows you how we allocate the capital we generate in a given year. So, first and foremost, you've heard numerous times today that we are focused on organic growth. That will always be the case, its number one. If we have a place to put our capital work organically, that's what we're going to do. We also think through strategic acquisitions, bolt-on investments like we've had with capital markets over the years. BlackArch Partners would be a case. We'll continue to look for that and we'll consume a little bit of capital, not a lot. The second is to have a solid dividend. We'd like to pay out 35% to 45% of our income in the form of a dividend to our shareholders. Today, we're slightly below the 35% level and you should expect us to approach the middle to that over to upper end of that over time. It's all about setting the dividend that's sustainable regardless of any plausible environment that we have. I'm happy to report that over the past three years, our dividend increases have resulted in a 26% compound annual growth rate, very proud of that. And importantly lastly, share repurchases. That share repurchases gives us the flexibility to invest in businesses, to invest in products and our services that are bolt-on acquisitions to the extent opportunities arise, in particular in a downturn. So we will continue to optimize our capital. We generate excess capital and cannot put it to work efficiently, we're going to give it back to the shareholders so we don't want to bloat our capital base. What that means is, our shareholders should expect a return somewhere in the 9% to 12% range each year. Now this particular year, we're not optimized, so we still have more capital to buy back than this. So for the near term that'll increase at 9% to 12% just a bit. Simplify and Grow, I'm not going to go through this whole slide, but what's important here is that we create more efficiency, become more effective in making banking easier for our customers. But financially, what it means is we're able to reduce cost base to reinvest that to grow revenue. At the same time, a portion of that goes to continue to improve our efficiency rate. So we're looking at continuing Simplify and Grow. John mentioned it, but I want to reiterate it. This is not a program. It's not a two or three year kind of thing. This is what we do each and every day because John Turner's asked us how do you get better every day regardless of what you do? So what does all this mean financially? We were hoping this to be the great reveal, but you got slides early. So any question [indiscernible] (03:17:45)? I couldn't help myself. So you know for 2019, we expect loans to grow in the low-single digits as well as over the three year period time again, commensurate with our expectations of GDP, as I mentioned to you earlier. We think with that growth and where we think the rate environment's going to be in 2019, we can grow revenue some 2% to 4%. Control our expense level to be relatively stable and we generate positive operating leverage obviously as the difference. Barb's already gone through charge-off, so I won't talk about that. So what does it mean for the three-year period? These are the commitments that we're making. 2021 adjusted return on tangible common equity, we believe, can range somewhere between 18% and 20%, as we work on both the numerator and the denominator. We will need to become more efficient. We're at 59.3% today. We're happy that we met the goal but 59.3% is not good enough for us. So we're shooting to have an efficiency ratio under 55%. And guess what, when we get there, we'll have another goal. So first things first, get to below 50%. 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2019 FactSet CallStreet, LLC And it's important that you leave with this. Our expectation is to continue to generate positive operating leverage each year over the next three years. We've done that for the past three years. We're going to continue that. So we're very excited about opportunities to continue to grow our company to provide an appropriate return by staying focused on these five areas here. And with that, we will stop and Barb will come back up and John and we'll take your questions. Corrected Transcript Investor Day 27-Feb-2019 to us going forward. Now three years ago, [ph] it was (02:55:02) November 2015 we're in this very room where we laid out our three year strategic plan for you. And I'm happy John showed this to you in terms of meeting and achieving all three of these risk adjusted return of 16.5%. It's on an adjusted basis, efficiency of 59.3% and you can see earnings per share growth of some 24%. The carve-out [ph] NIM (02:55:30) – the favorable impact of tax reform is 19%. Nonetheless we met the targets that we laid out at Investor Day. And we're very happy to report on that. So how we do that? We stayed focused on three strategic pillars, growing and diversifying revenue, managing our expense base and deploying our capital appropriately. So on growing and diversifying revenue, clearly leveraging our competitive advantage on deposits in a rising rate environment was a key driver, continuing to make investments in people, businesses, products, to grow revenue and as you can see over the three years, we grew revenue some 12%. We're very happy with that. We're in a very competitive business, commodity business. We differentiate ourselves on service, if you haven't picked that up from today. In a commodity business you better become really efficient. And we're happy that we've worked on this growing revenue but also watching our expense base and improved our efficiency some 480 basis points to 59.3%. But that's not good enough. We're not finished there and I'll show you what that looks like. We have to control head count, we have to control square footage if we're going to attack efficiency and we did that and we'll do it going forward. From a capital standpoint again, not growing for growth's sake, growing because it's the right thing to do with the right return profile, allowed us to free up capital, to divest the businesses and products that weren't giving us kind of return we wanted and redeploying that or giving it back to our shareholders. Evidence of that is in 2018, we returned some 154% of the capital we've generated back to our shareholders in the form of a dividend or share repurchase. So staying focused here is what allows us to give you the return that you expect. Now we have to go back three years and times are uncertain in terms of what might happen for three years. As you can see here, if you look at 2018 on the right hand side of the slide, you can see the 10 year finished about where we thought it would finish. But along the way, you can see the rate environment wasn't quite what we anticipated and therefore we had to adapt and overcome. We had the talk we want to do something different. So what did we do? A number of things, but a couple of them I point out. We had a $300 million expense program that we had established and that wasn't good enough. We went back to the well, and we added a $100 million to that program to have a $400 million expense program which got us to the end of 2016 when the rate environment finally started to increase. We could begin to extract the value out of our deposit base and grow net interest income and the resulting margin. The point of this slide is not just that we got to the three year targets that we laid out at Investor Day, that's important and we're glad we did that. But three years is a long time and we don't know exactly what will happen, but what we're telling you is we're going to make a commitment for these three years and we're going to get there. We may have to do it differently than we think today, but we'll toggle, we'll adapt, and we'll overcome. So we're excited about the plan that we're going to put forth. So let me transition into the next three years and tell you a little bit about how we're going to manage a key component of our income statement, which is net interest income. Net interest income as you know represent 65% of our revenue. Therefore we better be very good at managing our interest rate risk. As we think about our outperformance and net interest margin over the past three years, the driver of that is the core deposit franchise you've heard about numerous times today. It will be a key component, a key driver of our NIM outperformance for the next three years as well. 47 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2019 FactSet CallStreet, LLC Regions Financial Corp. (RF) Corrected Transcript Investor Day 27-Feb-2019 As we thought about how we manage interest rate risk, we went into this environment with the expectation that we're going to have growth in the economy. And as a result of that growth in the economy that interest rates would begin to rise and we would start to see the value of our deposit franchise, which we have talked about forever being our competitive advantage. You just couldn't see it because the rate environment was so low. So we were able to do that and you can see our outperformance in margin. As we think about the next three years, we have to think about how we're going to manage that interest rate risk, given the fact that the economy might be slowing. So for us, over the next three years, we have GDP this year of about 2.5%. We think we'll grow at about 2% in 2020 about 1% in 2021. Those are in the back in the appendix if you haven't already seen them. That's our base case. So we are not forecasting a recession, but we are forecasting a slower growth environment. Therefore, as that begins to happen, the risk of having rate cuts or rate reductions becomes more important to manage for us. Therefore, we're doing two key things: one, continuing to focus on risk-adjusted returns. We're not going to grow nominally. We're going to grow when we get paid for the risk appropriately. The other is beginning to enter into our hedging strategy using forward-starting derivatives, primarily interest rate swaps but some floors. Those forward-starting swaps and floors really begin in 2020. And the reason we did that is because we wanted to be able to preserve the ability to extract more value as the possibility of rates were going to increase here in the near term. Now, as of late, we're in perhaps a flat rate environment going from here. I'm going to talk about that in just a minute what it might mean to us. So we want to protect our competitive advantage called our deposit costs. So we have a very strong balance sheet. It's prepared for an evolving environment. It's a very simple balance sheet. On the loan side, on earning assets, 75% are loans. If you factor in hedging, we're about 50% fixed and 50% variable. If you look at the liability side of the balance sheet, 85% of our liabilities are deposits. That's the competitive advantage that we see. That large deposit base really adds to our sensitivity. If you look at how we've been able to leverage the deposit base, you can see our beta and this is our overall funding beta, which we believe is more relevant today. It's been 22% cycle today. Now we believe, based on our expectations, that that beta will be somewhere between 30% and 40% when we get to the end of the cycle. Now even in a flat rate environment, we do have some sensitivity that will be coming through in the form of repricing of loans and reinvestment of our maturing securities, some $13 billion over the next 12 months; as you can see, nine of that in the form of loans and four of that in the form of securities.

What that means is, our shareholders should expect a return somewhere in the 9% to 12% range each year. Now this particular year, we're not optimized, so we still have more capital to buy back than this. So for the near term that'll increase at 9% to 12% just a bit. Simplify and Grow, I'm not going to go through this whole slide, but what's important here is that we create more efficiency, become more effective in making banking easier for our customers. But financially, what it means is we're able to reduce cost base to reinvest that to grow revenue. At the same time, a portion of that goes to continue to improve our efficiency rate. So we're looking at continuing Simplify and Grow. John mentioned it, but I want to reiterate it. This is not a program. It's not a two or three year kind of thing. This is what we do each and every day because John Turner's asked us how do you get better every day regardless of what you do? So what does all this mean financially? We were hoping this to be the great reveal, but you got slides early. So any question [indiscernible] (03:17:45)? I couldn't help myself. So you know for 2019, we expect loans to grow in the low-single digits as well as over the three year period time again, commensurate with our expectations of GDP, as I mentioned to you earlier. We think with that growth and where we think the rate environment's going to be in 2019, we can grow revenue some 2% to 4%. Control our expense level to be relatively stable and we generate positive operating leverage obviously as the difference. Barb's already gone through charge-off, so I won't talk about that. So what does it mean for the three-year period? These are the commitments that we're making. 2021 adjusted return on tangible common equity, we believe, can range somewhere between 18% and 20%, as we work on both the numerator and the denominator. We will need to become more efficient. We're at 59.3% today. We're happy that we met the goal but 59.3% is not good enough for us. So we're shooting to have an efficiency ratio under 55%. And guess what, when we get there, we'll have another goal. So first things first, get to below 50%. 51 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2019 FactSet CallStreet, LLC And it's important that you leave with this. Our expectation is to continue to generate positive operating leverage each year over the next three years. We've done that for the past three years. We're going to continue that. So we're very excited about opportunities to continue to grow our company to provide an appropriate return by staying focused on these five areas here. And with that, we will stop and Barb will come back up and John and we'll take your questions.",error,error,error,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_Investor-Day-2019-Transcript.pdf

answer,"Right now, the restaurant industry, it's been challenged, and that's the casual dining segment. We have in our overall casual segment, we have about $700 million, give or take, and of that, you have fast casual which is a smaller percentage of that. So that's doing some flashing because people's tastes have changed, and we're following that. We're keeping an eye on things like ag and what's happening there and, of course, energy continues. We just want to make sure we don't take our eye off that ball. But in general, the rest of the portfolios, I am really feeling good about them and where we are right now.

answer,"Absolutely. Leverage lending book, I feel good about that too. The overall book is a BB+ plus book. About 12% of it is investment grade. It's something, as I said, we spent a lot of time on it., I spend most of my time on that looking at it to make sure that the people that we're lending to, the clients that we're lending to, any of the sponsors that we have that we really understand it. Like I said, it's not a growth portfolio for us. It's not a strategic objective. It's something we do to accommodate our best clients. And that's what we're going to continue to do. We have a limit on it, and we're going stay within that limit and have stayed within that limit. And we recycle out of that. If we see someone who isn't a client that isn't pulling their weight or a sponsor, let's step away from them. And we're going to continue – as I said continue to do that going forward.",Barbara I.

error,"Q I'm struggling a little bit with the symmetry of the NIM guidance, meaning that right now you're roughly at about – or last quarter, you're roughly at about 3.55% NIM. And in the upside case, you're at 3.7%; downside case, you're at 3.4% so basically 15 basis points either way. And if I look at the underlying assumptions, your upside case kind of has 50 bps I think or 50 bps of rate hikes, a little less than that in the long end but your downside case is much more dramatic on rates going down to zero. And I think over 100 basis points on the 10 years. So I would think you would see more NIM pressure in that scenario. So I guess I'm trying to understand what I'm missing in terms of how you're able to maintain a 3.4% NIM. I would guess part of it's hedging, but still seems like it's pretty resilient.",,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_Investor-Day-2019-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Well, key drivers. So let me talk about both of those and, Deron, you can jump in here as well, but on the upper end, our goal was not to try to [ph] top tick (03:22:58) our margin with kind of – and the 3.70% was picked because we think at that level we can generate the kind of return that our shareholders would expect. If in fact the rates continue to go higher than we thought over that 3%, we wouldn't participate to the level somebody else might because we've put in receive fixed swaps as a mechanism to protect us on the downside. The reason we're at that 3.40% are a couple of things. One is just a natural where our deposit book is. That's a key driver there. But it's also the impact of our interest rate swaps and floors and the prices that we [ph] struck it (03:23:38) to help bolster that 3.4%. So it's where we picked it, and we picked that because at that level, we think we can still, based on other adjustments we can make on our business model, generate the kind of returns that our shareholders would expect even in a down rate scenario. Anything else to add?","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_Investor-Day-2019-Transcript.pdf
answer,"I think that's well said. I think the only thing I would add is the asymmetry is really driven by the floors. The floors helped protect us in an extreme declining rate environment, and so it helps protect the lower end there. The upper end really is driven by – if we get additional tightenings and the rate curve pushes closer to 3%, that's moderately helpful. But we also think deposit betas begin to accelerate in that environment. So there is a bit of a dampening effect as to each incremental tightening and what it's worth to us I think.",M.

answer,"We do. And the other element that I would just add to that is that's not all just interest rate risk that drives us down to 3.4%. If you think about the environment that produces a declining rate environment, it's one in which likely a recession and credit costs are rising, you're carrying nonearning assets in the form of non-performers on the balance sheet, so that margin is incorporating all of the credit impacts as well.",M.

question,Chris Marinac at FIG Partners. I was curious for David or for Barb about CECL and the impact there. And are we at a point where we should think about any change to reserves as kind of looking at reserves and capital together relative to your low level of problems?,Christopher William Marinac,Analyst,FIG Partners LLC,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_Investor-Day-2019-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah. So I'll start. So we've done an awful lot of work on CECL. We're well prepared for the implementation. There's still some uncertainty as to what's going to happen with FASB and the regulators are waiting to see what they're going to do. But we're doing two things. One, we're approaching this as a [ph] 1/1/2020 (03:25:45) we're ready to go. We're running parallel this quarter. Sometime in the second quarter, we're probably going to provide some guidance. We're not prepared to do that just yet today. I know you want it, but we're not ready. We'll be able to – CECL day one is not the issue to us. It's day two. It's the impact to the business model for certain long-dated assets like mortgage. What's that going to mean from a pricing standpoint? I do think people will begin to look at both the reserves and capital as the buffer to absorb losses going forward. But the regulators are still working through what it means to them.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_Investor-Day-2019-Transcript.pdf
answer,The other thing I'll say about that is Barb referenced our business risk committees and we're taking the data that's coming out of our CECL work today and really feeding that in for the businesses to really kind of go back and challenge the risk-adjusted returns in that environment as well too.,C. Matthew Lusco,Chief Risk Officer & Senior Executive Vice President,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_Investor-Day-2019-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah. I'll add one thing. In April, the FASB's supposed to be coming back to tell us whether they'll make any adjustments based on the whitepaper that some 21 of us signed. We're hopeful that they'll make some change there that could help, in particular from day two. Ken.","David J.

answer,Yeah. Okay. Great. Sorry.,"John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_Investor-Day-2019-Transcript.pdf
question,"Great. Hi. Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Two questions on loans and, John, you mentioned at the beginning that you don't have to grow a lot to generate the type of returns and just if you can elaborate a little bit on the low-single digit core. Number one, this year you had a great year and start to – or end, I should say, to period end loans just the context of just the economy as you see going from here and any changes to the loan demand outlook would be great. And then, the second question is just the indirect auto runoff, could you give us an understanding of both the third-party exit and the indirect just what the pace of runoff is expected to be and presuming that's inside Barb's charge-off guidance as well? Thanks.",Ken Usdin,Analyst,Jefferies LLC,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_Investor-Day-2019-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah. So I'll start with it. And so we got some $3 billion of loans between both the indirect and then the third party, and you'll see that that's about a two-and-a-half year duration, Ken, that you'll see that running out, if that's how we choose to let it go. From a loan growth standpoint, I'll start. Loan growth we think is predicated on the environment that we're going into. There's a little bit of uncertainty with regards to GDP. It's a little slower 2.5% versus roughly 3% we had this past year. We had a good finish. As we think about the year, it's really not just about growth but is it the right kind of growth for us? And so we aren't about just growing the book if we want the right opportunities to grow. We think that we don't need a lot of growth. We need some but we don't need a lot to be able to make the kind of net income and return our shareholders are expecting.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_Investor-Day-2019-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah. I said earlier [ph] we don't want growth we're (03:29:04) with the economy maybe plus a little, it's a time to be cautious we think and selective. We talked a lot about client selectivity today. Our growth in the fourth quarter was broad-based across lots of different industry sectors within commercial and Corporate Banking primarily and pipelines were awfully full. We entered the year with softer pipelines because we had such a full fourth quarter but, obviously, that benefit helps carry us into the first and second quarter of this year. So and we'll continue to focus on client selectivity, sound underwriting and making good decisions, maintaining diversity across our businesses and taking advantage of the opportunities that we get. And again, we think we can deliver these results with that low-single-digit loan growth.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_Investor-Day-2019-Transcript.pdf
answer,And I'd make one additional comment on the indirect portfolio and that is we did not exit it because of loss rates. Our loss rates of our indirect portfolio were doing very well. It was because of the risk-adjusted returns.,Barbara I.

answer,"Right. Yes, Marty.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_Investor-Day-2019-Transcript.pdf
question,"So, Barbara, question for you then one for David. Appreciate all the work you've done in the last decade. I tell you working with you and watching you pull the portfolio for what it was to what it is now is probably one of the hidden things of Regions, [ph] the gems (03:30:26) that will play out over the next 5 or 10 years. So very significant amount of improvement that you've been able to accomplish. What I wanted to ask you was, when you think about all of the AI and all of the complexity that you've put into managing the loan portfolio amount, how do you make sure you get the personal review, touch, feel, you don't lose all that because we have so many systems now looking at all these loans? Because the thing that threw us off when we were at First Horizon was we had these computers, but then we just programmed them and made mistakes. So how do we make sure that we have that eyes on the loans and in the markets as well as all the complexity of the computers that help us right now?",Marty Mosby,Analyst,Vining Sparks IBG LP,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_Investor-Day-2019-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Well, you can't just turn over everything you do to a computer. A computer is a great aid, but you absolutely need the human subject matter expertise. And that's what we're committed to. We're committed to making sure that we're delivering to our customer that expertise. And remember it's not just about the loans when we talk to our customers. We're talking to our customers about that full relationship. We're talking to them about what they need to do for investment purposes, deposits, et cetera and that's not something a computer can do. And that's why, again, we are committed to the model that we have today with great bankers and great markets delivering great products. And yes, AI and all of those other tools will assist us, but they're not going to replace it.",Barbara I. Godin,"Senior Executive Vice President, Deputy Chief Risk Officer & Chief Credit Officer",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_Investor-Day-2019-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Marty, the other thing I'd add to that is the fact that we reorganized the risk team this year more closely aligned around the businesses. So we've got business unit chief risk officers, that are really intimately involved with the strategy, the development to provide real-time effective challenge and to kind of stress test the assumptions that are in there. So they're really very, very much – second line's very much in touch with the plan and with the business plan and kind of can help really understand as well as emerging risk indicators as well too. So we've got people embedded within businesses also.","David J.

answer,"In addition to what both Barb and what Matt had to say, AI is great. All the analytical tools are great. It provides wonderful data analytics and insights that we mind and think about but adding to what they said, we also have our business risk committees and those are led, as you heard earlier, by our line of business heads as well as our risk officers and they are talking about our clients and really mining and understanding what's going on.

error,"Q Told you we were going to give you a hard one. I gave you an easier one this year. When you're looking at your ability because you had the highest grant of buying back shares at the same time that you had the gift of the stock price dropping substantially, which is interesting to watch Regions perform because it goes down hard because of all the past history, not thinking of the new history that you're going to create. But then it doesn't bounce quite as much. How much of benefit did you actually get out of December and January when you had so much ammunition to buy back capital and was in a perfect period of time to be actually able to do that?",,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_Investor-Day-2019-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Well, I'm sad to report to you that not as much as we wanted because we had executed our plans. When we lay out our CCAR plan, we had to lay out the quarter in which we're going to execute the trades and we're not about timing the market with that. Our expectation is that the market will never push your price to true fair value with excess capital just mathematically. So when a new quarter – we would open up the window after our earnings release and buy back as fast as we can. We had exhausted our buyback for the quarter before that happened. As a matter of fact in the third quarter, where we bought back – now you've seen how much we had front-loaded it, it would have been nice to have that in December. Unfortunately, we didn't. So that being said, we still think it was the right thing to do. We need to get our capital optimized. We're 9.8% today. We're going to 9.5%. So we have – that's roughly $300 million, not counting what we'll generate. And we buy back those as soon as we can in that time. And unfortunately, we didn't get us to take advantage of that as much as we would've hoped.","David J.

question,"Thanks. One for Barb and two for David. Barb, I think you mentioned the 40 to 65 basis point NCO outlook. That's with the GDP forecast in the base case of a slowing GDP environment I'm expecting.

answer,"Yeah, we've said that for the 2019 year, our expectation is 40 to 50 basis points so I would expect if we don't have a downturn in the economy, it would stay in that level. As you said, we said 40 to 65 basis points over a three- year period. One of the things we've done we just didn't pull that number out of the air. We actually took our numbers random through our models, stress tested them and said what would resection look like on those numbers.

question,"Okay. And then, David, just two for you, one on the NIM outlook, current environment persists. It sounds like you're saying that – with the forward curve, you've got the current NIMs hanging out there in the next couple of years. Are you suggesting that the cost of the swaps is roughly equal to the benefit of the forward rolls on the $13 billion, is that?",Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co.

question,"Okay. Sure. And then lastly on the outlook for operating efficiency and expense improvements, last three years came with the lower staffing at 12%, and the lower square footage of 11%. Is that the same kind of run rates that you're looking for over the next three years or will the efficiency improvements be – be tilted to one area or is there something else that you're going to be pulling from?",Betsy L. Graseck,Analyst,Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_Investor-Day-2019-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah. You should not expect to see the reduction in the labor force to the extent you saw it this past year. That being said, we'll have fewer people three years out than we have today. If you're not controlling head count, it's our number one cost is 55% of our expense base. So we have pretty good controls over that. Every owner of people knows what their approved head count number is and the only way you can get more than that is you have to go through a lot of rigor to get there. And a few of us sit on a committee that won't allow it unless it's really good – good reason to do that. An investment to generate revenue would be one. We have to continue to work on our facilities. You'll see us continue to shrink our square footage. You saw John put up about 700,000 square feet each year for the next three years. We'll reduce – Brett Couch is in here that runs procurement and we're going to be working really hard on demand management. So not having to pull through as many consultants as people think they need, it's all areas, Betsy, of being able to reduce cost or at least stabilize it so that we cover our inflation and our investments this year we're going to keep our expenses relatively stable.","David J.

question,"Oh okay. So I think you have a tough job, right, with merger or no merger. And I think we heard today, you guys are fine with no merger. Don't disrupt the momentum is I think what we heard. You make your three-year targets. You have tech benefits ahead. You've efficiency benefits ahead, less head count, less real estate and you raised your ROE target, so all good. Let's stay on this course, I think, is what we heard today. The merger argument though would be don't delay. Maybe you have a BB&T and SunTrust moment. Maybe bigger is better. Maybe you can avoid some costs. Maybe there's benefits of scale when you're larger. Maybe you're in the best position of strength you're going to be right now. And don't forget the politics with the presidential election next year. You might not be allowed to do a big merger depending on how things play out.

answer,"Mike, I'd just to add to that. We were in the midst of a previously scheduled board meeting when the announcement was made at 6:00 AM on Thursday morning. My phone started blowing up. And as I said to somebody earlier, I had to sort of scroll wants to see. I thought it was fake news. I tell you. And so the board appropriately wanted an explanation, our understanding, and has challenged us to provide them with perspective on just the M&A environment, on that particular transaction at our meeting in April, which is something we routinely do anyway. So we'll have a good discussion about it, I'm sure. Any other questions? Yes.","John M.

question,"Gerard Cassidy, RBC Capital Markets. Barb, maybe you can share with us, you have given us guidance on the net charge-offs which relative to the last economic downturn obviously are much below where you guys had net charge-offs. But prior to the crisis, Regions typically had charge-offs at this level that you've outlined for the future. Aside from the de-risking of the balance sheet and possibly the merger between AmSouth and Regions at the time, what other changes have been made to reassure us that the charge-off levels will stay closer to your guidance than filter back closer to what they were in 2008, 2009?",Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_Investor-Day-2019-Transcript.pdf
answer,"People, process, and technology would be the three short answers. And primarily on the people side, it's not about we have a second line that being risk and they're in charge of the risk. I think you heard from all of my business partners today, every one of them talked about risk – unprompted by the way – talked about risk and that it's critical and it's paramount. They understand the risk in their book and they manage the risk at that first line. And second line comes in and we help them with it. So again, critically important. 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2019 FactSet CallStreet, LLC Our processes as well, is we have much better processes. Our concentration limits that we have in the past, they were good. But these weren't granular enough, as I said. And like I said now, we have over 100 of them in place, different concentration limits, and it's not a matter of when you hit a concentration limit, we all talk about it and say let's move it up. No, a limit is a limit is a limit. And we live within that and we redeploy our capital. Same thing with the technology piece as well, which is helping us as well with the early warning indicators and all those things that we look at in early warning indicators, we look at all of our different subproducts, et cetera. We have early warning indicators for each of them, and we're also in the midst of enhancing all of those early warning indicators because – and I'll use an example that David likes to talk about. If an earthquake happens across the ocean and a tsunami rises up, we want to be there when it first happens. We don't want to wait until we start to see the crest of the waves coming at us and saying, my, there's something we should do. And that's the reason that we've made so many changes, as I said, with the people side of it in particular as well as the technology and our processes. We're never going there again, Gerard, ever. We are much better risk people now than we ever have been. And we're going to be much better risk people as we continue to go forward.",Barbara I.

question,"As a follow-up to that, you mentioned casual or fast casual, you're just having an increased focus on it. In new originations today, where are you seeing greater underwriting risk that you're passing on, but you're seeing maybe smaller banks be more aggressive or the nonbanks? What areas and is it more loan to values on the commercial real estate side or is it debt levels in a noncommercial real estate situation?

answer,"Thank you, Barb. So you heard from Ronnie earlier and actually all of the business managers that we're seeing really good pull-through rates. I think, Ronnie, it's 80% for fourth quarter. But what we are seeing, we are being very diligent and we are passing on those opportunities that we don't think meet our risk profile and we're letting them go to the competition. And to the comment that Barb made, some of that is in the real estate. There are some markets that we see that are overheating. We have decided to change our advance limits and cycle out of that. We have done that in other asset classes. I think there was a question earlier around the early warning signals and as we see something flash yellow, we're taking appropriate actions to pull back.",Martha Raber,Executive Vice President & Head-Financial Risk,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_Investor-Day-2019-Transcript.pdf

question,"Thank you. Your charge-off guidance that you gave at your 2015 Investor Day was 25 to 35 basis points. You broke that level in 2018; you're at 40 basis points for the full year 2018. Can you just talk about what drove that? Was it the business mix, the focus of consumer and why we would think that there would be any upside risk to the charge-off quantification or the outlook that you're giving now?",John Pancari,Analyst,Evercore ISI,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_Investor-Day-2019-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Sure, you know back in 2015 when we gave the charge-off guidance, that was prior to the great collapse in energy prices and what happened is a year later, we looked at it and said, with energy, we increased that guidance a little bit. Now as we talk about the 40 to 50 basis point range for the coming years as well as then 40 to 65 basis point over the three-year period, that's premised on the mix of business that we have as well. So while you might see that our charge-offs were in that 40 basis point range, what you have to do is you have to match it against what the yields are because a lot of this, we talked about consumer unsecured. It's a much higher yielding product. Yes, it does have some increased losses, but when you look at that overall relationship, it absolutely makes sense for us to do that. So we will be staying in that 40 to 65 basis point range as I've said over the next three years. I don't want to prognosticate beyond that, but there's no reason that we shouldn't be – I'll use the word a [ph] Steady Eddy (03:48:59) in that net charge-off range going forward.",Barbara I.

answer,"John, to answer your question and maybe, David, help me here. Just more specifically though with respect to the 25 to 30 basis point, there was a change in mix of business with an increase in the consumer and direct portfolio.

answer,Five minutes?,David Jackson,Turner Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF 2019 BAAB Transcript.pdf
question,"...the last 12 to 18 months, and you guys have been very proactive in anticipating that. Can you give us an update on just, like you said, in the last five minutes, just how you're looking at rates as we go forward and into next year and how you've protected yourselves with some of the strategies you've implemented?",Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF 2019 BAAB Transcript.pdf
answer,"So let me start, then I'll let Deron talk about the details. So what's important is we do a rolling three-year strategic plan. And in 2017, we were looking at what was going to happen over the next three years. We knew there was going to come a time where we were not going to have leverage from rates. We knew the economy was going to slow. And with that was going to be a need for us to protect ourselves from a net interest income and margin standpoint. So we have this wonderful deposit base that we think is our competitive advantage. It has another side to that sword, which is if our deposit costs are low and our peers are higher, they have come-down room to protect their income and margin, and we didn't. So we knew we were going to have to enter into some form of derivatives to help us do that. So we started a plan to add derivatives, primarily interest rate swaps and some floors. Deron will talk about the details, but we did that starting – forward-starting when they were cheap for 2020, with the theory that as the economy slowed in 2020 that the Fed would become more accommodative. So economically, we're exactly where we said we would be. Where we missed it was that the Fed started to move into 2019, which caught us a little bit off. So we thought we were going to have two rate increases this year when we did our budget, June in December. Not only are we not getting the two, we got three, at least three thus far. So we're very thankful that the Treasury team, Deron leads that group of very talented people, and leads our ALCO [Asset/Liability Management Committee] process. And so won't you talk a little bit about the details of that?",David Jackson,Turner Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF 2019 BAAB Transcript.pdf
answer,"Sure. Actually, there are a lot of moving pieces, but our story when you boil it down is actually pretty simple. Through the hedging program that we've put in place, when 2020 starts we're fairly neutral to what the Fed does. And so fortunately, we don't have to try to predict what the Fed's going to do. The long end of the curve is still important to us and the shape of the curve, and that really primarily influences the rate at which new business that we'll be producing next year comes on the balance sheet. And so that's the residual exposure that we have. We've been – since quarter end we've updated our disclosures. We've been trying to chip away at that since we've seen this nice backup in rates. So last night at dinner, I told the group that at current levels, last night's levels, it was roughly neutral. What was rolling off the balance sheet and what's rolling on was roughly a push today. We've pushed over $190 billion now for the 10-year, so it's a modest benefit to us. But we're on either side of a push, I would say, so within 10 basis points. So the key takeaway from that is the impact of short rates not going to be a big driver of what happens to net interest income next year or the net interest margin. If we stay roughly at these levels, the balance sheet will reprice as we produce new loans, but that's not going to be a big driver either. If rates pushed below 180 basis points, call it down to 150, we do have some exposure as those new loans would come on at lower levels. We've been trying to chip away at that. We've hedged probably 30% of that exposure for 2020, somewhere in the 30% to 35% range. We'll continue to chip away with rates a little higher. And what we're doing there is pretty simple. We're just very tactically locking in the rate at which – the forward rate at which those new loans will come on. And then the loans will come on in the future, we'll unwind the swaps and the gain and loss will go into the yield on the loans. So it's pretty straightforward, but doing that is reducing that downside exposure that if rates trade back down to 150 basis points that we would have a bigger challenge trying to grow NII from there.",M. Deron Smithy,"Executive Vice President, Treasurer",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF 2019 BAAB Transcript.pdf
question,"And similar to the earlier conversation, if there are questions from the audience, just please raise your hand. Speaking of loan growth, maybe you guys can give us some color where you're seeing some opportunities for growth. How is competition – are there crazy – I guess there are always crazy lenders. But are there more of them today than there were two years ago or three years ago?",Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF 2019 BAAB Transcript.pdf
answer,"Competition in our industry when you have 5,000 banks, you have 5,000 credit unions, and a bunch of FinTechs is intense. It's been intense and it's going to continue to stay that way and get worse. If you ask every CFO about irrational pricing, it's always going to be that other guy did it, you never did it. The truth of the matter is we all do things for our existing clients that we would never do for a new client because you know what the full relationship is. And so we're probably all guilty of doing irrational things from time to time. I will tell you we're cautious in this environment. We set ourselves up through our hedging program to not have to grow a lot going into what we believe to be a 1.8% GDP environment for 2020. We ought to be able to grow loans on a net basis, that's net of our runoff portfolio, at GDP plus a little bit, so not a ton of growth. That growth will be manifesting itself on the commercial corporate banking side, maybe a little bit of real estate price, probably pushing on the consumer kind of flat. So I think that our clients are actually optimistic. They're being a little cautious with trade and tariffs and with Brexit and the election cycle. And all these kinds of things keep our customers from making that next dollar of fixed capital investment to grow because they're having – they had a good 2018. They're going to have a good 2019. 2020 is getting into the book already, and so they're not willing to take that risk. So we think loan growth will be a bit muted because of GDP. There are some that want to push through that, and we think that's going to be a mistake. We think over time that perhaps spreads can widen out because people have overextended themselves, and that's why we hold about $500 million of excess capital. We'll probably talk about that later on to be able to take advantage of opportunities should they arise.",David Jackson,Turner Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF 2019 BAAB Transcript.pdf
question,"David, one of the areas that we've seen some real strong loan growth is the industry is lending into the private equity area. And I think if you look at banks over $10 billion in assets, earlier this year, in the first quarter, where $400 billion was lent into the private equity area. And you guys are not big players there. And your disclosures, by the way, I think many of us would agree are some of the best in terms of your loan breakdown. Can you share with us? Are there any concerns in the loans to the non-financial – I'm sorry, non-depository financials?",Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF 2019 BAAB Transcript.pdf
answer,"When you make loans to people that are loans that you wouldn't make, you answered your own question, and that's how we think about it. Now are there some projects that would be from would sponsor and we like that particular sponsored entity, that's what we're lending into. So to give people money to go do things we wouldn't do with our own money directly is idiocy.",David Jackson,Turner Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF 2019 BAAB Transcript.pdf
question,Yeah.,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF 2019 BAAB Transcript.pdf
answer,"So we stayed away from that. There are some good sponsors out there. Leveraged lending is – you see our leveraged lending disclosures. We don't have a lot of that. We have in particular as you define it, the way that the regulators do, about $2.5 billion. So we're staying away from trying to stretch for that kind of growth. That's not who we are. We're a relationship bank. We're not trying to just grow the loan portfolio. And you can't make money lending money today very well. You have to have other things that come with that to make the relationship profitability, to get to the return. We have focused for the last several years on return on tangible common equity because it's the metric that's most closely correlated to our share price performance. We think that's what investors want. They don't want nominal growth of the balance sheet, nominal revenue growth, nor nominal net income. They want the right kind of growth that gives – that rewards the shareholders. So we're going to stick to that and not try to push. Gerard Cassidy Analyst, RBC Capital Markets LLC Q Maybe, do you have a question?",David Jackson,Turner Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF 2019 BAAB Transcript.pdf
error,Q [indiscernible] (00:10:35-10:48),,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF 2019 BAAB Transcript.pdf
answer,"Sure. So the question was how do we, given this challenging revenue environment, how do we leverage our technology, in particular REGGIE and ROSIE? So REGGIE is in our context. So these are AI examples in our context, and ROSIE is the next best action that's guiding our customer service reps to help a customer fulfill a need. Amala, why don't you talk a little bit about what we've done?",David Jackson,Turner Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF 2019 BAAB Transcript.pdf
answer,All right. And I think the intent of the question is our technology helping generate more leads in the digital channels and then out – is that fair to assume that that's the way the question was going?,Amala Duggirala,"Executive Vice President, Chief Information Officer",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF 2019 BAAB Transcript.pdf
error,"Q Actually a little more on the ROSIE side, but also I think on the expense side because [indiscernible] (00:11:30).",,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF 2019 BAAB Transcript.pdf
answer,"Okay, perfect. And we are heavily using artificial intelligence and bots on operationalizing quite a bit of back office functions that are in the organization. On the ROSIE side, ROSIE is heavily primarily focused on lead generation, the next best action in our channels, whereas REGGIE on the back end side uses IBM's Watson to help assist our contact center agents as to what is the next action to talk to the customer. It's like a virtual assistant sitting in the back office. And I think so far, we have about several expenses we reduced in our contact center, a number of head count, which is part of our S&G number that we have already articulated. And also what Watson is also doing behind the scenes is doing quite a bit of a machine learning and artificial intelligence so that we can do smart routing and we also know within the queue when the customer calls what can we do, can we take the customer off the queue by telling them we'll call you guys right back, so in that time we know of this issue. So there's quite a bit of efficiencies in development to do that. Just coming to specific machine learning, we are applying machine learning and then data analytics in two areas. One is revenue generating and expenses. On the revenue generating side, we've also done something called [ph] R-click (00:12:47), which is to our RMs through aggregated data platforms. We actually provide our RMs their operational account if there's a risk to the operational account, if there is an opportunity within the operational account for another sale that we can make, or also if there is a sale that they didn't even make to this particular account that we actually can make. So that is another area that RMs used to take more than seven to eight hours to do that kind of research in preparation for these things. We actually send it to them every morning and say in your area these are seven accounts that you actually can focus on. So those are some of the examples where we are heavily using AI and machine learning on efficiencies and also as a revenue generating partner.",Amala Duggirala,"Executive Vice President, Chief Information Officer",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF 2019 BAAB Transcript.pdf
answer,"Also, the [ph] R-click (00:13:33) that Amala talked about is fairly new. We're excited about what it could bring to us in terms of solving a customer issue by helping a customer fill a need. Your question came also from the expense side. And while we're happy that we leveraged some technology to help us there, I don't think we're near as far as we need to be on taking process improvement first and then leveraging the technology on whatever that new process is. Throughout the bank, whatever area you might be, including finance, I don't think we're where we need to be yet, which gives us some opportunity to hopefully continue to work towards a better efficiency ratio over time.",David Jackson,Turner Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF 2019 BAAB Transcript.pdf

error,"Q David, on your outlook for loan growth, while you've been very realistic, it's also a bit more downbeat than some of your peers on what we've heard in earnings through this morning. So is there something you have to flip-print, or maybe is it your loan portfolio that would necessarily have you have lower loan growth, or perhaps are some of the other management teams a bit more Pollyannaish than you all are?",,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF 2019 BAAB Transcript.pdf
answer,"I won't comment on the other teams, but I will say that part of ours is being careful on extending credit. So on the business side, we have our Corporate Banking group. We have Commercial Banking and Small Business, that's one segment, and we have Real Estate. Real Estate will get some growth. We probably have the second lowest real estate – I'm talking about investor real estate, concentration of any of our peers. We have some projects that we're looking at that we think we can get a little bit of growth, not a lot, but some. The commercial small business area is bread-and-butter. That's where we talk to clients a lot about what do you see in the economy, what are your needs going to be. And I think people are really cautious about that, and we don't want to force loan growth, we want it to happen naturally there. The area that we can grow the fastest in and the easiest is in the Corporate Banking group, so these are large institutional clients. A lot of them are Shared National Credits, thin spread, profitability on our loan is not great, hard to make the math on the return work unless you can be relevant to that client and you can get Treasury Management and other services. We've sought to improve our return in that area. And so we're asking that group really to recycle capital more so than grow, because growing means becoming eighth place in a syndication, where you don't even know the CEO or CFO. You're just not relevant. You've rented your balance sheet. That's not a good play for us. And so sometimes you have to do that because you have to get into a syndication, and then you have to work it over a couple of years to be more relevant. So we'll do some of that. But for the most part, it's really recycling capital. So you're not going to get growth from one of our largest areas. And I think that's a bit why we're probably less optimistic about net loan growth. But again, we don't have to have the kind of performance that we need to have for 2020.",David Jackson,Turner Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF 2019 BAAB Transcript.pdf
question,"David, speaking of capital, maybe you can give us an update on your views on your CET1 ratio and what you may see for that over the next one to two years.",Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF 2019 BAAB Transcript.pdf
answer,"So I'll start and let Deron add to this. So our common equity Tier 1 target of 9.5% hasn't changed, so we finished last quarter at about 9.6%. That number will move to 9.4%, 9.6%. We'll be right around the hoop on 9.5%. Like our CECL number, which we changed our range to $500 million to $600 million versus $400 million to $600 million, so that will cost us, call it, 40 basis points, just around that. That will be phased in over four years, so 10 basis points. We need to see what the regime is going to look like from the regulators over time relative to CECL to see if the required capital numbers come down as a result of having a much larger reserve, don't know. If not, then we've just put more capital essentially into the system. So 9.5% is our number today. That does have 50 basis points of management discretion. Our calculation is actually 9%, and we set that so we can protect our dividend even in a downturn. And so the 50 basis points is used to take advantage of opportunity should they arise. Oftentimes you can make more money when there are problems if you're careful. And so if we can get to our return hurdles with 50 basis points of extra denominator, that's not a big deal. Do you want to talk a little bit, Deron?",David Jackson,Turner Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF 2019 BAAB Transcript.pdf
answer,"Sure. So I would just echo the comments. The 50 basis points is there for us to use opportunistically, 9% is our quantitative target. But when we see opportunities to lean into growth that we think is accretive to achieving our overall growth, strategic, and return objectives, you should expect that we're going to find opportunities to grow faster, and we will be able to bring that capital level down closer to 9% over time. So again, it's dry powder to use opportunistically when we think the growth opportunities are there.",M.

question,"Yes, John?",Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF 2019 BAAB Transcript.pdf
error,Q Can you just talk about your appetite for M&A? I know it's been a bit of a focus [indiscernible] (00:19:12) deals. And then just talk about on capital and opportunities there [indiscernible] (00:19:17-00:19:24).,,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF 2019 BAAB Transcript.pdf
answer,"So the question was – it was about three questions, but let's say I start, John. The first one is really how do we think about M&A, and the second part of that is how do we think about technology investment in connection with M&A. Did I get that right? Okay. So it's been interesting to see some no to low-premium deals over the past period of time. We had obviously First Horizon and Iberia in our markets that got together on a no-premium deal. I think it causes us to think differently about it. We get a question of where do we want to participate in M&A, and we've said up to now that really we've got a lot going on, we don't really see doing that. The math doesn't work for us, and that's when the target was asking for a lot more than where we were trading. Our currency wasn't strong enough to really participate in that. Now you start seeing no-premium deals and low-premium deals. That changes the calculus. But let's not get carried away with that because before you even get to that calculation, you've got to think about what is the strategic rationale for doing a deal to begin with. And for us, having more density in our existing markets would be a rationale. We look at targets, and we have our list we've been tracking forever and a day that we really look at the right side of the balance sheet. We want to know what type of customers, deposit customers you have. Do you have checking accounts? Do you have operating accounts of businesses or do you have a bunch of money market CDs and hot money? You need to answer that question and then go over to the left side. What kind of loan portfolio and how might that fit with who we are and what kind of growth might we get off that that's reasonable? And then oh, by the way, if they have a deposit system, we'll talk about that in just a minute, that would be a nice [indiscernible] (21:15), a little something extra for all you LSU fans, that we have – that we look at that. And then we say now what's it going to cost us to get that. And at the end of the day, the no-premium, low-premium deals give you a little more leeway if you had made a misstep in judgment on something. So I think the market is rewarding those deals. It's what we've seen over the last two. I think we could participate in something like that perhaps, but we're not running out trying to knock doors down. Right now we're all looking up and seeing what's really going on in the market. From a technology standpoint, I think to John's point, we are going to replace our core deposit system over the next roughly five years, and Amala can talk about that if anybody wants to go deeper into that. It's not going to change our expense run rate. We've been planning for this; it didn't just happen yesterday. We've known this was coming. And if an acquisition can solve that problem, that's wonderful, but we will never use that as a reason why",David Jackson,Turner Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF 2019 BAAB Transcript.pdf
question,"Was there another question, Ken?",Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF 2019 BAAB Transcript.pdf
question,"I just wonder if you could just talk about loan growth and talk about credit quality has been very good, very stable, even in in the tough pockets, you haven't really said anything. In terms of this kind of up and down of a 1.8% GDP environment, is anything changing as you guys look out?",Ken Usdin,Analyst,Jefferies LLC,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF 2019 BAAB Transcript.pdf
answer,"We really feel like credit quality still is relatively benign. There's some normalization in certain credit metrics that are happening. This particular – this last quarter we had about $500 million of migration into substandard. We had a $300 million reduction in special mentions, so really $200 billion net of criticized or classified increase. We had a reduction in non-performers, I think $77 million worth, Dana? Is that right, $77 million? And so charge-offs were 44 basis points, within our 40 to 50, and I think that – we still believe credit is okay. You have an issue from time to time with the credit. There are certain industries we're watching closer than others, and I think energy would be one that you would naturally expect us to be watching closely. By the way, we did have the results of the Shared National Credit exam that are reflected in all those numbers in the third quarter, and that's really important because a lot of – some of that's energy related. And as I mentioned to people before, the way the rating works for Shared National Credit for energy is the total leverage inside of the company, it's not the senior secured piece on oil or gas in the ground, which is what we lend into. But the rating is one rating, and so anyway we expect a lot of that to be resolved in a fairly short period of time. Fast casual is another area we're having to watch fairly closely. Agriculture, because of trade, we're watching that as well. The beauty about this is that we don't have any concentrations like we did pre-crisis. So we don't have any one thing that can really upset us. But we have to pay attention to certain of those segments. All in all, Ken, I think credit is actually in pretty decent shape.",David Jackson,Turner Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF 2019 BAAB Transcript.pdf
question,"Maybe circling back to technology for a moment, Amala or David, we often hear from the big banks how much they're spending on technology. And the question you get from investors is how do the smaller regional banks or just regional banks compete? Can you share with us what metrics should we as investors look at, not just for Regions but for smaller banks other than the universal banks, that shows you that you are very competitive and here are the metrics to prove it or vice-versa? If we can't keep up, then we're going to have a problem. I don't know if you have any suggestions on what we all should be looking at to see who is actually fighting very well against the big banks.",Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF 2019 BAAB Transcript.pdf
answer,"I'll start, and then, David, you can jump in. So I get asked that question many number of times compared to the big banks. Budget numbers is what we look at and say can you compete with the $10 billion spend versus $625 million spend. And I think Regions Bank is in a very, very sweet spot when it comes to that agility and flexibility that we have at this point of time. We do not have the complexity of any of those large banks at all. We do not have the scale to deal with the number of branches or the international regulations forces. So I think the place where we are in, we do have a very simple architecture. We have one system. We have one core system. We have one brand system. Recently we did have an upgrade and we have already advanced a wealth platform, which we are in the cloud as of right now. We replaced about 12 systems to get to one single platform on the cloud for wealth. We upgraded our mobile online platforms completely to next generation. We have upgraded for the next four to five years of volume and the speed at which we need to move. And then you look at corporate systems, we are on a [indiscernible] (00:26:40) with loan origination systems. So you name it, in every place we are clean, we are fast, we are agile, which kind of helps us and positions us in a unique spot. But when you're looking externally, what should you look for is when you're looking externally, what you really have to look for is the customer accolades and then look at the surveys, the Gallup surveys and things like that. What are our customers talking about? That's one way to look at. J.D. Power might be, [ph] Jacqueline (00:27:05), Gallup. When you look at those metrics, we're always the top quartile in those metrics. In some of the surveys, we are the number two in online in some surveys. And then in mortgage servicing and fulfillment, we're usually number one. And when we fall to number two, we actually lose to Quicken more than a peer bank. So our competition is [indiscernible] (00:27:28). So that's one variable I would always advise people to look at. What are our customers saying? Where do you stand with respect to your usage and all? The number two thing you could look at is, are we providing our customer a choice in their banking? Are we forcing them to come to a branch, or are we actually provide them a multi-channel and an omni-channel approach? The choice in banking is the bank making investments into providing a customer a choice in their banking is the second aspect that one can look at. And the third one is a question that has already been asked. Are they investing in the right technologies? Are their investments going into artificial intelligence, data analytics, robotics, efficiencies? Is the bank reinventing itself on a constant basis rather than sticking with the old practices? So I think that is the third thing you want to look at. Cloud maybe or upgrading the systems, what is the approach they are taking to upgrading their systems? Those are the things you'd want to look at, to observe if the bank is relevant or not. But as Regions Bank, we are in a very, very sweet spot to attend to our customer needs, in a speed and pace that is unmatched with any of our other peer banks as of right now.",Amala Duggirala,"Executive Vice President, Chief Information Officer",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF 2019 BAAB Transcript.pdf
answer,"Dana can tell me what page it's in, but it's in the deck that you're looking at that shows at the bottom a number of third-party results in terms of technology comparisons. That gives us some pretty good feedback. We look at every competitor and what they're doing. Clearly, we can't spend the kind of money that the money center guys can, but we've yet to see a competitive advantage as a result of technology that we can't copy quickly. What they have is a lot more money that they can put into marketing. And so that's important, in most of our markets we don't compete with a money center bank. We are the money center bank in the markets that we choose to operate in. And so that's why this density, getting back to M&A question, density in those markets make that market very, very valuable to you. So we have to continue to invest and stay on top of it because this is changing. But it's table stakes, it's not the competitive advantage.",David Jackson,Turner Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF 2019 BAAB Transcript.pdf
question,"Shifting to an area that we really haven't discussed much this morning, and it's not who you guys are all going to vote for, but if next year there is a change in the White House and a populist gets in, the question is when does a bank like your bank at the board level, when do you sit down and start to put some strategies on the table to discuss if there's a dramatic change in the political outcome come next November? The markets don't appear to be saying it will happen, but you never know. So it's more when do you guys – or can you plan for that kind of stuff?",Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF 2019 BAAB Transcript.pdf
answer,"Wow, I'm going to try to answer that and stay out of trouble, since this is taped. There are some things you just can't predict. I do think that we're in a very unique election cycle with different choices. We'll see what the Electoral College does to us, and I think those are things we don't try to anticipate just yet. Now, if something wild starts to happen, then it's incumbent upon us and our board to be thinking strategically about how to address whatever circumstances that exist at the time. But trying to anticipate that at this juncture I think would be, one, it would be a very painful exercise, but I just don't – I don't think any good can come out of that. You may make a decision, a bad decision there for an outcome that you predicted that didn't happen. And so we think that in the back or our minds we don't give it a lot of thought just yet.",David Jackson,Turner Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF 2019 BAAB Transcript.pdf

question,[indiscernible] (00:31:30-00:32:15),Nancy A. Bush,Analyst,"NAB Research, LLC",regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF 2019 BAAB Transcript.pdf
answer,"So the last part of that is no. So the question is would we stay in a market if it's not profitable because we feel compelled politically or otherwise to do that. We run our company to be profitable. We do have to take care of our communities and make investments back in our communities. It's incumbent upon us, it's part of our shared value. Shared value takes care of our associates, our customers, the communities in which we choose to operate, and our shareholders. All four of those we have to consider in all of our decision-making. Our company is made up of some small markets, a lot of small markets and some growth markets. And it's that small market concept that has really helped us and the density we have in those markets to give us our competitive advantage, which is our deposit base. Two-thirds of those deposits are consumer deposits. Of those, half of them, 60% of those are customers that have been banking with us for over 10 years, so a very loyal customer base. As long as we continue to serve them like they want, we'll keep that, and that's really what is fuel for our growth in net interest income and liquidity. So we understand certain of those markets aren't growing. They might even be shrinking, which is why we've made investments in some of our growth markets. So this past year, our investments included Atlanta and Houston, St. Louis, which is not a growth market but a big market and where we're positioned there on what we call the S-curve with that next dollar of investment actually is paying us back. And the fourth one is Orlando. So what we're doing is we want to maintain control over those smaller markets. Whatever they turn out to be, make sure they're profitable, realign the network if we need to, which we've been doing over time, but make investments in some of the faster growing markets as well. We don't want too much of that because we're competing with a different bank when we go to Atlanta. And those are going to be more volatile and higher cost deposits for us, but we can use some of it.",David Jackson,Turner Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF 2019 BAAB Transcript.pdf

answer,"Okay, there you go.",David Jackson,Turner Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF 2019 BAAB Transcript.pdf
question,"There you go. Okay, there you go. Good point. Another question that we have, coming back to interest rates, David, is there an environment that – what would really keep you up at night on a yield curve or things just go haywire somehow? What environment would that be for Regions, since you've done a real good job in planning for the current environment? But if there's a curve ball out there, what would it be?",Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF 2019 BAAB Transcript.pdf
answer,"It was originally rates. And we've done a good job, I think, of hedging and protecting ourselves in an ultra-low rate environment. As Deron mentioned earlier, the 10-year we have had a little bit of exposure, but we're taking care of that. Today's a good day to take care of even more. So I think it's economic output. We need the rest of the world to come along and get better and heal so that the economy can grow not at 1.8% but 2.8%. That would be wonderful. The environment which I don't think is very probable but which would be difficult to deal with would be a negative interest rate environment. I think the Fed has come out said we're not going to let that happen because we don't see proof that that really made a positive difference. But that would be tough to deal with. We need – a flat yield curve is problematic, not just low rates but flat. If we can get low rates and a little bit of slope, we can make some money there. And so it may be challenging, but I feel pretty good about 2020. We are committed to positive operating leverage in 2020. I was asked that two times I think back-to-back on the call, as if I made a mistake. So you can write it down, we're okay with that. We're not committing how much, but it will be challenging. Over the next three years, 2020 is going to be the most challenging on positive operating leverage because of the challenge with NII coming off of the first six months of 2019 having a much higher rate environment. So I think this could be a challenging year for our industry, but we think we've put a lot of things in place to really help us outperform.",David Jackson,Turner Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF 2019 BAAB Transcript.pdf
question,"One of the areas that we have nice growth in the organization is on the investment banking side of the fee revenue. Can you give us some more? I think you mentioned obviously challenges at the net interest level, net interest revenue side. Can you share with us some of the growth that you might see in that line item?",Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF 2019 BAAB Transcript.pdf
answer,"So non-interest revenue – so NII is 65% of our revenue, and that's going to be a challenge. We just committed to positive operating leverage. That means NIR really needs to come through along with controlling expense. So in NIR, we have five categories there. Service charges is number one. That really is driven by account growth, account meaning checking accounts and operating accounts. So that's why that is foundational, fundamental to who we are. You've got to get that if you want to succeed. We feel good about that. Next would be check card, ATM fees, more accounts, more cards, the usage is going up. We all use more cards then every year. It's going up if you look at the Fed data. We're on a relative basis probably the largest debit card user in the country, on a relative basis. And the third category would be mortgage. Mortgage ought to have a pretty decent year next year with low rates. Capital markets; capital markets is – they've got four or five businesses within there. It's been a little bit challenged this year. We got off to a slow start in the first half – I mean first quarter with the government shutdown, but we think capital markets is going to have a good fourth quarter. We've talked about that being a $45 million to $55 million revenue business, call it $200 million a year. It's going to fall short of that, but I think that going forward we'll get the M&A piece going. We've got the Fannie Mae DUS program that will pick up for us. The derivative sales, that's probably going to be challenging and we got a CVA adjustment and there that's probably going to put a little challenge to us. Syndications, loan syndication business doing okay. And then fixed income sales and trading, which we stood up, hired some really, really qualified people to help fund that piece of the business, could help us grow in capital markets. And the fifth one would be wealth management. Wealth management, we hired more wealth advisors. The market will stay at 18 times plus. We should be able to grow AUM and grow wealth nicely.",David Jackson,Turner Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF 2019 BAAB Transcript.pdf
question,Marty?,Gerard Cassidy,Analyst,RBC Capital Markets LLC,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF 2019 BAAB Transcript.pdf
question,"A bigger question, but I'm going to ask it anyway. If you think about selling to anybody, not that you're selling recent [indiscernible] (00:39:27), would you love to be a $25 billion bank or a $125 billion bank given the dynamics that we're seeing in the market right now? So not necessarily Regions, but it used to be if you were a $25 million to $35 million, you get a premium still, and it was a good place to get to. That may not still be the case, so I was just curious how you thought about that process",Marty Mosby,Analyst,Vining Sparks IBG LP,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF 2019 BAAB Transcript.pdf
answer,"So the question was if we were a seller, would you rather be a $25 billion bank or a $125 billion being given multiple differences? So early on, the multiples for the smaller banks were in the 20-plus range and the $125 billion banks weren't. They were substantially lower. I think the only benefit I see on size is that you have more people that can buy you at $25 billion versus if you're at $125 billion, no one but the money center guys are really out. There are only a handful of people that can really get together. That's the limitation you have when you're our size. I think at the end of the day, it's incumbent upon us all to run our franchises appropriately and earn the right to be independent every day. And if you can't drive your car appropriately and get the returns to the shareholders, then somebody else gets to drive. That's that simple. We think we have a good strategic plan. We've been executing the plan. We've done what we said we were going to do. And as long as we can continue to do that, we are in control of our destiny, and we'll look for opportunities to help fill in, as I've discussed just a minute ago on our M&A discussion. To the extent we run out of gas though and we've done all we can, then we would do something different and be part of another entity. We still have a really competitive deposit franchise we would do something different and be part of another entity. But we still have a really competitive deposit franchise. Not many people have what we have. Now it's more valuable when rates are going the other way than they are coming down. But nonetheless, of course, stable deposit base give us franchise value that people would love to have, but we want to leverage that ourselves and can do so.",David Jackson,Turner Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF 2019 BAAB Transcript.pdf

error,"Q Maybe the best place to start because you had some interesting slides in the deck, and it's kind of one of the hotter topics around the conferences kind of just net interest margin and deposit costs. And in the slide deck somewhere you had in the earnings call, you talked to the margin kind of staying in the 3.40-ish or I guess you had 3.45% margin in the second quarter, kind of reiterating you expected to be in the 3.40% range in the fourth quarter and then actually begin to increase in the beginning of next year. And you kind of had that on the earnings call, kind of reiterated the guidance today despite the fact you've seen a much greater than expected drop in the 10-year treasury yields. At the same time, you've had deposit costs coming down in the last several months, which was in contrast to some other banks which have seen deposit cost to continue to increase. Maybe talk to in terms of how you manage the balance sheet against the current interest rate backdrop and maybe after that touch on how you manage your deposit base?",,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF Barclays Transcript.pdf
answer,"Okay. I'll start, let Deron chime in. So, thanks for having us. We had anticipated this environment happening that is the economy slowing down, [ph] a little more (00:01:59) accommodation coming from the Fed. We had anticipated that happening in 2020, not 2019. So there was a little bit of disconnect in terms of the economic performance and Fed policy. So our hedging program that we started to put in almost two years ago really starts in 2020. We're a little bit more exposed in 2019. A couple of things we've been able to do, though, is really watch our deposit costs. We gave you a slide in the deck that shows our expectation for deposit costs coming down in the third quarter. We have, on the consumer side, a little more programmatic in terms of how we set deposit costs. On the commercial side, which was a big part of our beta going the other way in the first quarter, were short-term contracts with large customers that we were able to adjust pretty quickly. And that's why we had confidence that we were going to be able to bring deposit costs down. We saw that at the latter months of the second quarter. We disclosed it into the third quarter and that's where we were able to offset a bit of the pressure that we have on the rate environment that has changed since earnings. And we're giving you the approximate 3.40% in the fourth quarter. Do you want to elaborate on how we think about the balance [ph] sheet (00:03:18)?","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF Barclays Transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah, so, obviously, we've been thinking about managing that short rate exposure. Obviously, our hedges kick in in early 2020. We've messaged that we think that we're not defenseless in 2019. We do have the ability to continue to manage deposit costs. And we think that that will allow us to keep the margin relatively stable, maybe a couple of basis points, if we were to get an additional ease, couple of basis point impact to the margin per ease. And then once we start 2020, we're relatively neutral to changes in the short rate. Obviously, you mentioned the long end of the curve coming down and that really impacts us in two ways. One, and really the preponderance of the impact is being driven by new business originations across our lending businesses, the fixed rate term lending in the mortgage space and then in C&I term lending. And so over time, the long end of the curve really neutralizes what was a longer term tailwind for us that we had a balance sheet that was repricing upwards before we've messaged that we had as much as 70, 75 basis points earlier in the year tailwind from the balance sheet repricing, as new originations come on. Today, that's largely neutralized. It's a modest headwind for us on the long end of the curve. The other impact of the long end coming down is prepayments in our securities and our mortgage business. So we think that through asset selection and through the coupon selection that given where rates are today, that's fairly manageable. We think the impact is relatively small. We've updated our slides for sensitivity and based on forwards at the end of 6/30, which really takes the long end down to in the low-1s, we think our sensitivity is in the 1% range from an NII standpoint. And it's fairly stable. It's fairly stable if we stay sort of in this area with the 10- year to modestly lower. But in terms of managing the balance sheet, we're trying to, around the edges, think about from a reinvestment standpoint of what's going on in the balance sheet, how to minimize that exposure to prepayments and just keep the position fairly stable from here.",M. Deron Smithy,Treasurer & Executive Vice President,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF Barclays Transcript.pdf
error,Q I guess one area some banks have complained about is just premium amortization. Can you just talk to the impact of that?,,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF Barclays Transcript.pdf
answer,"Sure. So as we messaged last quarter that – so premium amortization was in the high-20s, $28 million for the quarter, I believe. We expected that to tick up a bit over the next couple quarter given the reduction in long-term rates. Again, we think we probably migrate up into the low- to mid-30s as a run rate at the current level. If we were to see the 10-year move meaningfully lower down below 1.50% into the, call it, 1.25% range and we didn't see any meaningful spread widening with respect to new mortgage origination rates, we could see that tick up into the mid- to upper-40s – 30s, sorry, not 40s. But we think in this range, it's fairly manageable, very modest increases. 70% to 80% of our book today is economically disincentivized to prepay, that obviously if we move another 25 basis points or more lower, a greater percentage comes into the money, so to speak. We think the premium level is down materially from the last declining rate cycle. We've been focusing on not adding a lot of premium to the book. And so we think the increase in premium am, as long as we stay roughly in this area, is pretty manageable.",M. Deron Smithy,Treasurer & Executive Vice President,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF Barclays Transcript.pdf
error,"Q Helpful. And then, I guess, in looking at the slides, your revenue growth guidance, I guess, previously was kind of lower end of 2% to 4%. Now you're kind of solidifying it at 2%. Is it the kind of the modest change in kind of the NII outlook or is there something else?",,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF Barclays Transcript.pdf
answer,"That's the primary driver. Of course, 65% of our revenue comes from spread, certainly having pressure there from the rate changes since earnings. But we're also having some benefits on NIR with mortgage. Mortgage is going to be strong for, I think, the industry this quarter. There'll be a little bit of get back on CVA/DVA adjustments, fair value adjustments. But net-net, we feel good about NIR. So, that change – we are already to the low end of the range. We just thought it was more prudent given we're another quarter closer in that approximately 2% was the right answer for investors.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF Barclays Transcript.pdf
error,"Q And you guys have been talking about low- to mid-single-digit-type loan growth for the year. Given a lot of the uncertainty with trade and tariffs and just the overall economic outlook, at least if you read the papers, just maybe talk to in terms of what you're hearing from your borrower base, kind of where you're seeing growth, where you maybe have some buzz?",,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF Barclays Transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah. Our customers are generally still optimistic, I would say, but more cautious particularly given some of the volatility and conversations about trade and tariffs. Pipelines have been steady. I would say they're good, not great, [ph] seeing (00:08:55) a little uptick in the last 30 days, plus or minus. Production has been pretty good, growing commercial loans. We have [ph] some of our (00:09:05) portfolios particularly on the consumer side. Within commercial, we're seeing growth in a couple of our specialized industries groups, specifically technology and defense and financial services where we have some real expertise. And we will continue to, I think, see modest growth which will offset some of the runoff that we have in other portfolios.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF Barclays Transcript.pdf
error,"Q I guess as you talk to your borrowers as they can, to plan to think about next year, just any thoughts on kind of the current environment kind of restraining kind of CapEx spending and the like and how do you kind of go about kind of thinking about what we should expect?",,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF Barclays Transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah. I mean we think the economy is still sound. As I visit across our 15-state footprint and customers that I've talked to have solid 2019, they feel good about 2020. The biggest constraint on the economy still is the availability of qualified labor. And then I think some reluctance on the part of businesses to invest given the uncertainty about the impact of tariffs and some of the volatility, and given the conversation the Fed's having about cutting rates, if you're a business owner, you think the economy is good. But if the Fed's going to cut a rate, what message is that sending to business today is the Fed knows something business doesn't know about the overall economy. And I think that's creating some pause.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF Barclays Transcript.pdf
answer,"I add to that. As I mentioned, we saw this coming of slowing down and we positioned the balance sheet with hedges to protect us so that we would not have to power through to get NII growth through unusual loan growth. So we don't need a lot of growth to propel us into 2020. We need some, but we think going into the 11-year expansion trying to power through and outgrow and have unusual growth was going to introduce credit risk that we didn't want to have. So we're confident that we're going to get the kind of growth that we've planned for.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF Barclays Transcript.pdf
answer,"And to that end, if you look back a couple of years, I would say we've done three significant things in anticipation of slowdown. First was the hedging strategy that we've talked about. The second was we've been derisking our portfolios. We've exited certain businesses, indirect auto, consumer, indirect unsecured, medical office building. We've changed the composition of our real estate business and reduced our reliance on it, all to position the balance sheet to be much stronger and more resilient through challenging times. And then we introduced our Simplify and Grow initiative now back in the latter part of 2017, first part of 2018 again to help us begin to drive efficiencies in our business in anticipation of a time when we weren't going to benefit from rising rates and credit was going to begin to normalize. So all three of those things were ideas that we developed over the last, call it, 24 to 36 months in anticipation of where we are today. We think we're well positioned.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF Barclays Transcript.pdf
error,"Q I want to come back to Simplify and Grow in a second, but you talked about derisking and you've kind of got at three or four areas that you've, I guess, had some concerns about. Is there – I guess is – what is the kind of next in the balance sheet you're keeping an eye on, not necessarily maybe you would jettison it, but where portfolios or geographies that you maybe have a bit more trepidation than others?",,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF Barclays Transcript.pdf
answer,"Well, we're always focused on investor real estate, particularly given our history. We think we've reconstituted that business, built it around really quality professional real estate bankers, really solid customers, good markets. Our exposure is very manageable relative to our peers. It's one of the lowest. It's also a business that is producing good fee revenue and deposits. It's a solid business. Beyond that within commercial where we have a leveraged portfolio that we continue to rigorously examine and service and [ph] stress (00:13:15) on an ongoing basis, we've called out fast casual in the restaurant sector and the energy portfolio, we naturally have energy exposure. It is less than it was in the energy when the energy recession began, but it's still an important business to us and one that we'll continue to be in. We've again remixed that portfolio, reducing our [ph] auto services (00:13:39) exposure down to about 13% of the total exposure, largely in E&P and midstream business, but one that we're watching given the volatility in that commodity.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF Barclays Transcript.pdf
error,"Q Helpful. And then on Simplify and Grow, I guess you never actually told us kind of what metrics you were tracking towards from a revenue or an expense standpoint, but I guess where are we in that program? Has it kind of lived up to your expectations? How much more benefit do you expect from that?",,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF Barclays Transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah. So one of the reasons we didn't tell you what to expect was we didn't want the program to have a beginning and an end. It was about creating a culture of continuous improvement. So we get better as we say every day at what we do. We have benefited significantly from the program. I would say that we've realized less than 50% of the business – 50% of the opportunity that we ultimately envision. We began with about 40, plus or minus, initiatives. We accomplished 12 to 15 of those. We now have 60. So the point is as we're completing certain initiatives, we introduce new ones. And so we might be talking about it next year here at this conference and I might say again that we've realized less than 50% of the benefit, because we really view it as continuous improvement and we do think it has had a really significant impact. It's allowed us to make investments in our business and people, capabilities and technology and markets, all while not increasing our expense base.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF Barclays Transcript.pdf
answer,"I'll add that we didn't give very specific here is how much revenue, here is how much expense. We had just come off two expense programs as you recall, and having this continuous improvement program was real important. It did manifest itself in us giving some metrics of positive operating leverage each year and efficiency ratio target that we laid out below 55% in our third year. So it's because of the process of continuous improvement that we're able to see that and we still have that challenge for us that we laid out at the Investor Day just, what, eight months ago.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF Barclays Transcript.pdf
error,"Q So I guess in thinking about that below 55% efficiency ratio, if you kind of look at the current backdrop, say, the rate environment gets more challenging, economy slows as some predict, how confident are you, you can actually get to that figure? And maybe in the context, maybe talk about some of the bigger opportunities in Simplify and Grow yet to be realized?",,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF Barclays Transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah. I would say that we're, like I said, eight months into the program. Obviously, the rate environment's very different than we thought. Very similar to the last three-year program, if you remember, rates had dipped down. And we had a three-year plan that ended in 2018. The 10-year finished about where we thought it would be, but along the way, it declined. And so we had to do something else. We had to call [ph] it inaudible (00:16:44) and we did that through a couple of expense programs, and we've met the objectives that we laid out. That would be our plan this time is to continue to pull different strings to try and achieve the goal. To the extent we have a low rate environment that persists through all three years, achieving a 55% or below efficiency ratio would be very challenging. I wouldn't call it out of the question, but they'd be extremely challenging. The low-hanging fruit on expenses have been picked. The way we get better today is making banking easier for our customers. It helps generate revenue, but it also takes out processes and steps and head count, so we get to win both ways. And so the question is, if rates are going to be here lower, we just put that much more pressure on ourselves to continue to evolve quicker than we otherwise would have to try and achieve the goals that we laid out.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF Barclays Transcript.pdf
answer,"We underspend FF&E. David talks about reductions in a number of branches still an opportunity, and then using technology to evolve our back office processes to be largely automated so that manual processes are largely exception in nature. We think there's a real opportunity to do that. As an example, within our call center, we're using artificial intelligence, the IBM Watson product. We've been able to answer 2.5 million calls in the last 12 months. That's effectively the equivalent of we estimate about 50 FTE that would have been handling those calls otherwise. That's the success we've had early on that we see an opportunity to really build on through the use of artificial intelligence [indiscernible] (00:18:23) work we're doing.","John M.

error,"Q Okay. I guess there's a big merger going on in your footprint between BB&T and SunTrust, moving the headquarters, coming up with a new name. A lot of employee – or it would have to [ph] hit your cost head numbers, (00:18:40) employee reduction. There's got to be some customer overlap. You would think it'd be a big opportunity to pick up some market share.",,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF Barclays Transcript.pdf
answer,"Clearly, transactions of that size are disruptive. We'd say BB&T and SunTrust, two very good banks run by very capable CEOs, they can do a great job with merger, I'm sure, and are providing really good leadership in their markets. But there will be disruption. We're seeing that and we want to take advantage of that as those opportunities arise. We have specific plans targeted at customers, targeted at associates to whether it's in Atlanta or Orlando, East Tennessee where they have a strong presence. We'll continue to focus on those opportunities. We don't forget there's disruption in other companies as well. And so our challenge to our bankers is to be actively engaged, focused on the right customers and the right opportunities. If we do those things, we are consistent in our approach. I think we'll have nice success building our business.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF Barclays Transcript.pdf
error,"Q I guess when they put those two companies together, they touted the importance of scale, the importance of having to invest in technology, and it felt like being as bigger would enable them to do that. Obviously, Regions is a byproduct of two sizable MOEs. I guess as you look out, what's your thought of another? And if you're not going that route, do you feel like you have the scale and the technology to compete, because those two – it seems like they didn't feel like that way?",,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF Barclays Transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah. A two-part question. I'd say first, we do think that we have the scale to compete. We don't believe that increased scale is an absolute requirement for us to be effective. We're making $625 million in technology investments this year. About 42% of that will go toward new capabilities, new technology to serve customers and to help us improve efficiencies and effectiveness. I'm often asked, well, how do you know that you're successful, and I would say that we're growing consumer checking accounts, we're growing consumer demand deposits, growing consumer low-cost deposits. Our customer favorability score is some of the highest in the industry. Half the accounts we're opening are for individuals who are 30 years of age or younger. And so, in markets like Atlanta, Orlando and Houston, where we're making investments in physical facilities, we're seeing a significant increase in new account openings. And so, we believe we absolutely do have the scale to compete. In fact, I would argue that regional banks, given the fairly flatness of our organizational structure, the fact that we are less complicated in the way we operate, we have one branch platform, one deposit system, one loan system, we can make changes more easily and less costly than many of our peers. And so, we think technology can be a real advantage for us. With respect to M&A, we think our plans, as David talked about, will deliver outsized returns on a relative basis for our shareholders if we stay focused on the things that we can control. And so, we're not interested in bank acquisition today. We stay aware of what's going on in the market. We're obliged to and periodically review MOE opportunities or at least the concept, if you will, with our board, just as we're obliged to talk to them about who might be interested in acquiring Regions or what we think the market conditions are. But given all those things, given what we know about – and our ability to execute our plan, we think remaining independent and staying focused on the execution plan is the right thing for our shareholders.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF Barclays Transcript.pdf
error,Q Helpful. Can you maybe talk about your interest in non-bank or bolt-on acquisitions? I know you did the Highland Associates deal earlier this year.,,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF Barclays Transcript.pdf
answer,Yeah.,"John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF Barclays Transcript.pdf
error,"Q So, maybe talk to what that brings you and kind of what other products, capabilities you feel like you need.",,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF Barclays Transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah. I would say – thank you – non-bank acquisitions are something we're interested in, and we have had some success. We've acquired an M&A advisory firm a few years ago. We acquired a low-income housing tax credit syndicator. We recently announced the acquisition of a wealth management – effectively an outsourced Chief Investment Officer function, Highland Associates, focused on the not-for-profit healthcare space, which coincidentally aligns well with our oldest and I guess most well-developed Specialized Industry group, and that's our Healthcare Banking group. So, we're excited about that. We've acquired mortgage servicing rights portfolios. That's a capability that we have. We think we're a low cost, very effective servicer. So, we will continue to look for enhancements to our business, add to – allow us to diversify our revenue, to meet customer needs and to address specific capabilities in areas like wealth management, like capital markets, like mortgage banking, where we think we have an opportunity to continue to grow.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF Barclays Transcript.pdf
error,"Q Helpful. I think this is the first time you're speaking publicly since the 10-Q was filed. One of the things that jumped out to me was your, I guess, CECL disclosure. Reserves will be up $400 million to $600 million, and clearly manageable, but I guess a 45% to 65% increase in the reserves was more than we had expected. Maybe just walk through kind of what's driving that increase [indiscernible] (00:24:15).",,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF Barclays Transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah, sure.",M. Deron Smithy,Treasurer & Executive Vice President,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF Barclays Transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah. So, we had $400 million to $600 million we disclosed in the 10-Q that we'll have day one. We'll tighten that up as we get closer to implementation. The real driver of this is the Consumer side. Any asset that has duration on it really gets much larger reserves than another portfolio. So, for us, mortgages, HELOCs, unsecured consumer credit, far more of the reserves are being attached there. And it's just a case of, for consumer assets under an incurred loss model, those have a tendency to have a very short period of time sitting in the reserve. So, just for demonstration purposes, maybe a mortgage asset has one year of losses sitting in the reserve under an incurred model, and mortgages, I think we could all settle on being about a seven-year duration asset. So, you got seven times that in Consumer, and you keep doing that over HELOCs and unsecured credit. That's where those numbers really come from. We're going to have to evaluate what the economy looks like at the time of implementation. So, things can change, making that $400 million to $600 million less or more. So, I talked to a lot of my peers after our release. So, we're one of the first ones that have put something out. I think you'll be surprised that we're not going to be all that different. The composition of one's portfolio does matter. So, certain of our peers that have more business services loans are going to see that kind of change that we will have, those of us that look like us that have the larger amount of Consumer will.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF Barclays Transcript.pdf
error,"Q Helpful. I think the other sentence in the 10-Q was CECL could impact Regions' ongoing earnings perhaps materially. So, I guess we kind of understand the day one impact. Maybe talk about the day two and beyond impact and how CECL impacts your decision to lend, what type of loans you're going make going forward, the duration of those loans, and your thoughts about lending to the extent that the economy faces a sharper – a downturn.",,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF Barclays Transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah. So, that comment on could be material probably got more attention than we had intended. What we're trying to demonstrate though is today, as the economy begins to degrade, the pace of provisioning under the incurred loss model is far slower than under CECL, which is what FASB intended. They wanted that provision to be quicker, and I think investors perhaps wanted that as well. So, when the economy does change, you're having to make a change on the entire portfolio for life of loan losses, which makes the volatility much higher day two going forward. Specific to your question on origination, we're going to have to wait and see. At the end of the day, we're in the business of making loans to help individuals and businesses grow. But the economics now have changed when you have to front-end losses. And so, will that change pricing? Will that change the duration of what you're willing to put on your books? So, take a mortgage loan, when we do – put a 30-year mortgage loan on the books or are we going to sell all that and just put short-term? We're going to have to figure all that out strategically. And if we sell this to the agencies, they also have CECL. What are they going to do? Are they going to increase [ph] the fees (00:28:00) that then get passed through to the customer? So, there's a lot of uncertainty that's out there with regards to CECL and how it's going to affect the entire economy, which was one of our arguments that we're putting in the standard that's life of loan that's going to be very difficult in the transition. Over time, we'll all figure it out, but we're likely to have a little bit of volatility on the front-end.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF Barclays Transcript.pdf
error,"Q Well, I'll pause there and we can start with the ARS questions, similar to ones we asked the other bank presenters, the first one just around stock positioning. So, 25% overweight, interesting. Last year, Regions went from 7% to 29%, which was one of the larger increases of any company. So, it looks like they maintain that, although it looks like a majority [indiscernible] (00:29:13) position, which creates an opportunity. And then, we'll go to the next one. [ph] Could have led (00:29:18) with this one. But where do you expect Regions' 2020 NIM to be? Point of reference, 2Q was 3.45%. So, we'll figure out what the buy-side consensus is. So, 3.30% to 3.35% kind of the most popular answer, followed by 3.35% to 3.40%, so, some degradation, but not too much. And I would say a little bit below that kind of 3.40s number you kind of suggested in the first quarter. You gave us some line of sight on Q1 of next year. Any thought how to think about the remaining three quarters, I guess assuming just the forward curve plays out as expected today?",,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF Barclays Transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah. So, again to reiterate, we think around 3.40% is sort of where we end the year, somewhere in that neighborhood. And then, as the hedges kick in, depending on what the Fed has done between now and then, we think we see a modest improvement up into the low-3.40s, and it's fairly stable from there. Again, depending on what happens to the long-end of the curve, today, it's marginally unhelpful. To the extent we could get a slightly higher long-end of the curve, we could see some ability to modestly increase that over time, but it's relatively stable in this environment in the low-3.40s.",M.

error,"Q I guess when you – you obviously look at the balance sheet under a lot of different scenarios, I imagine. Some people would ask me about the impact of negative rates and what happens and how you'd react in that scenario.

Maybe talk to kind of your thoughts around that.",,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF Barclays Transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah. So, clearly, negative rates are not helpful. And so, we've done some analysis around that and some thinking about how the business model is impacted and what are our defenses. I think at this point, I do think it's not probable, but it's something we have to think about and be prepared for. I think there's some opportunities to look – to think about are there additional hedging strategies that may seem well out of the money today, but in that negative rate environment could have some value. We'll continue to evaluate those in the context of probability and cost. But again, I think that's something we're thinking about.",M.

answer,"Yeah. So, you utilize history, but you also utilize changes that you've made in underwriting and different – we're a completely different bank than the crisis. So, it's all about what our expectations are for life of loan going forward, leveraging history, but you don't have to just follow it without other considerations. So, we've looked over the financial crisis as to what ultimate losses were then. We've taken into account all the changes in the profiles and underwriting. We have a reasonable supportable period of two years for all of our portfolios, and from that, we'd revert back to historical norms through the life of the portfolio we have today.","David J.

answer,"Yeah. So, I would say our – that portfolio is well-diversified. It is largely centered around – is built around customers that we have relationships with. There is about 25%, 26% of the portfolio that's – that are two companies that are sponsor-owned. We're not lending directly to private equity groups, but instead to companies that are potentially owned by private equity groups. That's down from a high of, I think, about 35%. So, we view that sort of enterprise value, sponsor-owned portion of the portfolio as being the most high-risk. We are servicing that portfolio at least on a quarterly basis, in some instances monthly, so stressing it, and again, managing it to a specific concentration. We think the overall quality is good. A significant portion of it is investment grade, and it is largely – at least the higher credit exposure is underwritten by our Specialized Industries groups. We have a dedicated leveraged finance team and a dedicated enterprise valuation team as well. So, we think it's well supported by a lot of expertise and we have the right controls in place to manage the risk.","John M.

answer,"Yeah. So, there's a lot in that question. I think we started a couple of years ago thinking about negative rates through CCAR in the process. We've continued to evaluate it. Obviously, earlier this year, we thought it was a very low probability. It's something we've spent more time thinking about lately. I think what I mentioned, the potential hedging in the derivatives space is really just again to try to put protection on that, if short rates did go negative that we would continue to benefit, because what generally happens is we do have the ability to manage deposit costs. As rates move lower towards zero, obviously that gets floored out when we get to zero. But your assets continue to reprice down. So, we would be looking to offset that exposure through the derivatives market. In terms of asset classes that may perform better in that environment versus others, I think it's still early. We haven't formed any firm opinions there yet.",M. Deron Smithy,Treasurer & Executive Vice President,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF Barclays Transcript.pdf
error,"Q Additional questions? We can go to the next ARS question then. Which of these 2021 targets do you think will be hardest for Regions to achieve? Well, the efficiency ratio [audio gap] (00:38:00) most popular one by far, followed by the [ph] RO (00:38:05). I guess, David, you've mentioned that it would be challenging to get to that number in a difficult economic or rate backdrop. I guess as you sit here today and we kind of play out the forward curve and assuming no recession, do you still think that number is doable?",,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF Barclays Transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah. I think that to the extent we [audio gap] (00:38:35) this low rate environment persists through all three years – so, we're into 2021, we're still here – the 55% efficiency ratio and 18% to 20% on return would be very difficult to achieve. I think that, again, we want to be realistic about the math, right, because you can do the math just like we can. But we're only eight months into this and we don't want to give up. There's still levers we can pull. The easier ones are on the expense side than the revenue side. We've already told you what our capital is going to be. We're not likely to want to pull the denominator below our comfort zone just to meet some return target. So, while we're not giving up on that realistically, both [ph] one and two (00:39:24) would be pretty challenging if [audio gap] (00:39:27).","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF Barclays Transcript.pdf
answer,"But I would say we are committed to continue to drive efficiency down and believe that over time, as an industry, we've got to be more efficient operators. We'll do that through the use of technology. We don't intend in this environment to curtail our investments, spending that we think will ultimately – technology spending that will ultimately positively impact the customer experience and the way we do business. And so, while those numbers may be more difficult to achieve in this environment, we're still committed to trying to get there. We're not going to do anything to harm the franchise, but we are going to continue to make investments that we think will enable us to effectively alter the way we do business and positively impact our efficiency ratio.","John M.

answer,"1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2019 FactSet CallStreet, LLC Yeah, so I'll start and let Deron talk a little bit about the margin but for the year, we're still intact with what we – the guidance we gave, which was larger than 3.50% for the year and we finished the quarter at 3.53%. So, obviously, to average 3.50% for the year, you should expect that to decline some. We have day count issues in the quarter, they'll put some pressure on this next quarter. But that, yeah, it gets harder with all the volatility we've seen with rates but that's largely intact from a loan growth standpoint. We did change our guidance on loan growth to low to mid-single digits based on the outsized growth for the first quarter, that was higher than we expected. We funded that loan growth with higher cost deposits, which put pressure on our NIM. We think that moderates as some of those customers that have access to the capital markets, actually choose that path. We've seen that last couple of years in the third quarter. We're not sure if that'll happen but that's historically what has happened. So we think that growth rate that we saw in the first quarter won't be there at that pace, but for the year, we think low to mid-single digits is intact.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF Transcript.pdf
answer,"I think that's well said. I would just add, the economy still feels pretty good in the markets that we're in. Our customers are more cautious than they were 60 days or so ago but they still have a positive outlook about the balance of the year and their performance. I do think because of the uncertainty, what we spend a lot of time talking about is focusing on the things that we can control, focusing on the fundamentals of our business, managing our expenses well, staying focused on soundness, profitability, good client selectivity. We think it's a time to be careful with all the uncertainty. We couldn't have imagined that rates would have moved as far as they've moved in the last 90 days. I suspect nobody else here could have either. They could move back just as quickly potentially. But fundamentally we think the economy is still solid. Credit quality is still very good but it is a time to stay focused, we think, on the fundamentals of the business.","John M.

answer,"Yeah. So, I'll start. So, as we've messaged, reaching an inflection point what it feels like on rates with, perhaps, the Fed, we were thinking pausing and staying at a level rate for a while. Now, perhaps, pivoting to potentially [ph] an ease at (00:06:59) some point, there's a natural progression that you see in the deposit book when you go through these inflection points. And as we've studied it historically, you generally see that there's, perhaps, as much as 12 months of continued remixing that you see in the deposit book following the last Fed tightening in a cycle. So as we've mentioned, we've been going through that the first couple of quarters of this year. We expect some of that to continue here in the near term, which would put modest pressure on the margin in the near term. But we think that that sustains itself and our efforts to manage the balance sheet, manage the overall efficiency of how we finance ourselves in the – and the overall optimization of the balance sheet efforts will cause that to stabilize second half of the year and then we'll – what we have been messaging is that we've got a bit of a tailwind or have had a tailwind in terms of a re-pricing of the balance sheet both in securities and loans. We've messaged that that's 30 to 40 basis points. When we gave that guidance coming out of the second quarter earnings, obviously, rates were materially higher than where we are today, that does change that trajectory a bit, but we still think that our overall efforts to manage deposit cost and overall efficiency of the balance sheet will allow us to stabilize the margin and put it on solid footing as we enter 2020.",M. Deron Smithy,Treasurer & Executive Vice President,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF Transcript.pdf
answer,"So, there was an expectation that there would be – the economy would slow a bit. We had 3% GDP last year, our expectation was GDP would be 2.5% this year, going to 2%, going to 1% over the next couple of years. So as a slowing was going to occur, we believe the risk of rate reductions were higher beginning in 2020. And so a little over a year ago, we began to put some protection on – to manage that [ph] a bit (00:09:01). And what's happened is, it's quicker than we had anticipated with regards to 2019. So our protection – and Deron, why don't you talk a little bit about the protection and what that looks like in 2020 and 2021?","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF Transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah. Sure. So we've been working on trying to bring our asset sensitivity down closer to neutral for the better part of one to two years now, being very methodical and trying to move our position out on a forward basis closer to neutral over time. We pick 2020 as – looking back in 2018, we thought 2020 was a timeframe over which we thought the slowing economy could produce a need for the Fed to ease. And so we may be slightly off on that but we began our protection. It's laddered through a little bit in late 2019, most of it in 2020 and runs through 2025. 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2019 FactSet CallStreet, LLC And it's a combination of interest rate swaps and interest rate floors. And we constructed that hedging program to do two things: one, allow us to continue to enjoy an expanding margin in a potentially rising rate environment but also begin to protect us if the Fed were to pivot toward an ease. And what we've been enjoying is low deposit costs over this tightening cycle. And as deposit costs have stayed low, well clearly if rates begin coming down, we have less room to bring them down. And so we used interest rate floors, struck at levels where we thought that the ability to bring deposit costs down started to be a headwind for us. And so the construct of the swaps and the floors in a flat rate environment, where the Fed does nothing is roughly a push. There's expense on the floors in the form of premium that we have to start to amortize. But there's positive carry on the swaps, those two roughly offset one another. And so in a flat rate environment, you see very little impact to our margin and growth in NII going forward. In a rising rate environment, we continue to enjoy the ability to see an expanding margin. And then we've got the downside protection if the Fed were to pivot to an ease.",M.

answer,Yes.,M. Deron Smithy,Treasurer & Executive Vice President,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF Transcript.pdf
error,"Q Okay. And so if the Fed cuts earlier than that, is there some protection against that or we wait till 1Q 2020 to get the protection?",,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF Transcript.pdf
answer,"Well, we're certainly not defenseless, again going back to the construct, our initial defense against that is just bringing deposit cost down. And so there's a bit of remixing that is going on now, obviously, that we've referenced but we would have the ability to start bringing deposit cost down if the Fed were to ease. And I think that that would help us maintain. There would be an incremental margin pressure from that, but it would be short lived and very manageable. And we think we can still stay within the guidance that we've given, not the 3.50% full year guidance, but the longer-term guidance that we've given, 3.40% to 3.70%, even if the Fed were to ease this year...",M.

Maybe we could shift to talking a little bit about capital optimization? John, I know that in Investor Day, you spent quite a bit of time talking about that.

error,Q ...recent acquisition that you did?,,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF Transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah, I think our focus on risk-adjusted returns, capital optimization has been really important across the business generally, whether it'd be remixing our Shared National Credit portfolio, exiting certain loan portfolios over time like an office building as an example, where we thought the returns were marginal, exiting some of the construction lending activity we were doing. All those things align with our desire to make sure that we're using our capital as best we can, we're getting appropriate returns for the risk that we take. We made the decision to exit indirect auto and to not renew our GreenSky agreement for the same reasons. David likes to say profit zones open and close. In indirect auto, our belief was that just we didn't see a future to profitability unless we were willing to potentially take more risk and we weren't. We don't – we're not a subprime lender, we don't want to be a subprime lender. And so our conclusion was, we should exit that business.

Turner, Jr. President, Chief Executive Officer & Director, Regions Financial Corp. A The GreenSky relationship was also at a time very satisfactory. We got into that business for a couple reasons: One, we wanted to participate in the point-of-sale lending activity. We wanted to see how it worked, what it was about, the consumers were clearly preferring that channel and so we wanted to understand it. We felt there was an opportunity to build relationships with those customers, at least there was some potential. We wanted to see whether or not that was true. And over the course of the last couple of years, we have learned. But we've also learned that – we learned a lot about the channel, we've also learned that there really is not an opportunity to build relationships. As rates began to rise, returns weren't as good as they had been. We had an opportunity to exit. The contract that we have with them expires in November and so we decided to do that and to reallocate the capital into other parts of the business like commercial banking, where we have had a strong legacy business and one that we think we can continue to grow; like non-bank opportunities, capabilities. We just announced the acquisition of Highland Associates this week – I guess, last week. It's a small acquisition but again we pick up customers, we pick up talent, we pick up capabilities that we didn't have that allow us to expand the relationship that we have within the not-for-profit healthcare space, where we've been very active for a long period of time. We have a specialized lending group that's very mature and seasoned. We also believe that Highland had some relationships that we're not banking. And so the combination of their referral to our team, our team referral to them, we think, will allow us to grow that business. So those are some examples of things whether it'd be BlackArch Partners, First Sterling, acquiring mortgage servicing rights, all things that we want to do with the capital that we free up in order to continue to build our business.","David J.

answer,"Yeah, so, we get that question a lot. It's important to know how we built that up, so it's mathematically derived. We start at – [ph] this was (00:19:22) Common Equity Tier 1, so we start at 4.5%, we add a 250 basis point buffer to get to 7% and that's the limit that we set for ourselves after our severely adverse impact, because we want to not have to cut the dividend like we did in the crisis and so sustainability of the dividend is really important. And as 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2019 FactSet CallStreet, LLC you know, we're trying to get to 35% to 45% of earnings to be paid out in the form of dividend. We're a little below 30% for the year last year. So you should see that continue to increase. So, protecting that and also not having to raise dilutive capital again would be – is in order. So set the limit at 7%. From that we've run our stress test and those stresses imply about 200 basis points that we add on to get to 9%, and that's mathematically what the answer would give us. We have made a decision to add 50 basis points for a management buffer given we're in [ph] 10 year (00:20:27) of an expansion. We have volatility in the marketplace. We can achieve our return metrics even with the extra 50 basis points of capital. And so to have a little bit of cushion for uncertainty to take advantage of opportunities should they come our way, be able to make loans when others can't because they're too tight on capital would be an example, we think gives us the flexibility we'd like to have. So, could we run lower? We could but there's no need to do that.","David J.

error,"Q Now, you don't have to do CCAR this year or any year.",,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF Transcript.pdf
answer,"Well, we didn't have to do it this year, we'll do it next year. We did have to file a capital plan, which we have submitted. It goes through the governance, it goes through all the processes we've always had. We didn't change that at all. We just didn't have to fill out thousands of pages of templates to submit. There's an expectation that we have a robust capital planning process from our board [ph] on down (00:21:27) through John. And we're not going to give that up, that capital planning process has made us a better bank. We have better insight into loss forecasting as an example. And so we've kept that to help, to inform our capital distribution plans and we'll fill out CCAR for next year.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF Transcript.pdf
error,"Q But as I think about your comments on the divi, right, and the goal to have a little bit of a higher dividend payout ratio. Is that something that you expect is gradual over time or given that this year is not a CCAR official process, there is a little more opportunity to reach that goal or move towards that goal?",,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF Transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah. So we manage capital irrespective of whether there's a regulator out there in the CCAR process, that's not how we think about it. We manage capital the way we think we need to manage it. And so we've made the decision to have a 35% to 45% payout because at those levels that is sustainable in any plausible downturn that we can come up with. And so we've been at the low end of that and there should be some expectation over time that we get that at least to the middle of the range. And when you don't have places to really put your capital to work, the economy's not giving that, maybe that payout ratio is a little higher in times like that. What we like about today not having to file CCAR is the ability to manage capital every quarter the way that we want. So if loans aren't growing as fast as we had anticipated, we can buy more stock back. If loans are growing opposite then we would not buy back as much. So, managing to that 9.5% is what investors really ought to think about because – and it may not be perfect but it will be close to that 9.5% which we'll get there in the third quarter.","David J.

answer,Yeah.,"John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF Transcript.pdf
error,"Q ... that's how I would describe it. In about half the MSAs, top five, and in the other half, you're in 5 to 10 share in terms of deposits. Is that a metric that matters to you? And maybe you could give us a sense as to how you're thinking about managing your investment in the branch?",,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF Transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah. It's a metric, I mean think share's important. And in the markets where we have significant share, we do really well and those that we don't we're trying to figure out how to get share and to grow the business. We have closed approximately 250 branches since 2013, and despite that, have grown consumer checking accounts every year from now for – we're in our seventh year of growing consumer checking account. So, we feel like we're doing a good job of optimizing the branch system. We've recently made some changes in our branch footprint in St. Louis as an example, closing branches, building new branches and improving our access to customers by more than 10%. So 10% more customers, more than 10% more wealth amongst those customers and as a result we're seeing growth there. Our business is still principally in seven Southeastern states, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Georgia, Tennessee and Arkansas, concentrated heavily in Alabama, Mississippi and Tennessee. So, markets like Mobile, Jackson Mississippi, Birmingham, Huntsville, Nashville, Memphis, we have number one, two market share. That's really the core of our platform. But we're investing in places like Atlanta, Orlando, Houston and St. Louis. And what we're beginning to see is a growth rate that is better than two times the company's growth rate. So the company is growing at 1.3%, in Atlanta we're growing more than two times faster than that. Same thing is true in Orlando because we're able to place our branches in key locations, right locations. We're adding wealth talent, we're adding commercial banking talent. We think the combination of all those things is leading to a good return on our investment. We will close over the next three years about 100 branches and open 75. And the bulk of those openings will be in those markets that I mentioned, Houston, Atlanta and Orlando as we reshape those footprints.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF Transcript.pdf

answer,"Strictly commercial banking, yeah. But our businesses, and we talk often about the way our bankers team together and some of you hear us talk about our Region360 (sic) [Regions360] approach to banking. That teaming approach is, we think one of the things that differentiates is the way that we do that. And so we believe it's important not only to build branches but to make sure that we have wealth bankers and commercial bankers in the markets who can help leverage that investment that we're making.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF Transcript.pdf
error,"Q Okay. And from the branch deposit perspective, is your growth strategy purely organic or is there any interest in inorganic as well?",,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF Transcript.pdf
answer,"Well, I think there'll be opportunities that come along that may be of some interest to us. We've said pretty repeatedly that bank M&A is not in our future at least currently. Economics aren't good. More importantly we think we have real opportunities to improve our business through our Simplify and Grow initiative and so M&A would be a distraction for us. On the other hand, there may be some divested deposits that we would have some interest in whether it be as a result of the SunTrust BB&T merger or some other event, we'll certainly pay attention to that because gaining more customers in markets that we're in, we think, is clearly advantageous to us.","John M.

error,Q ... digitally but also protect yourself from folks that are digitally entering your markets?,,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF Transcript.pdf
answer,"So we'll spend $625 million this year on technology. 42% of that spend will be on new initiatives, new processes, new capabilities. And we have fully digitized, as an example, our consumer lending process and so today roughly 62% or 63% of all of our mortgage applications are completed online. 51% of our direct consumer loans are originated online and closed via e-signature. So a customer never has to come into a branch, actually never has to talk directly to a banker because of the way the process works. We think that's a capability that fewer than 25% of our competitors have based upon research and data that we've done. We continue to invest in our mobile app and in our online banking platform. We're developing voice capabilities and actually may introduce those later this year...","John M.

error,Q Interesting.,,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF Transcript.pdf
answer,"...which we think is very interesting. Some of you've heard us talk about the way we're using artificial intelligence in the call center to field calls and as a result of that, we've reduced head count by over 55 people in the call center and are more effectively answering calls. We're using artificial intelligence to [ph] inform (00:29:35) what we call next best offer through a capability that we've affectionately named ROSIE, but our branches and our contact center are using that technology as we talk to customers, helping us identify what we should next talk to the customer about based upon their potential preferences, similarities to other customers. So we're excited about all the technology that we are developing and are using in our business. We think that we are very much keeping up with our larger bank competitors. We're often asked, do you have the scale to compete? We believe we do. And when they asked why we believe that, I'll point back to we're growing consumer checking accounts, we're growing consumer demand deposits, our brand favorability is very high. Customers' willingness to refer us to another friend or a relative is very high. And so those things, to me, are proxies for the quality of our consumer banking offering. If we weren't growing, I'd be concerned. But the fact that we're growing and growing despite closing 250 branches, I think, is pretty powerful.","John M.

We do have a strong brand across a good portion of our footprint. I think brand favorability still matters. We've got – branch locations still matter even though those under 30 year olds may not use us a lot, brand favorability is driven, I think, in part by the density of our branch footprint. And, again, I think the quality of our technology offering combined with density of the branch footprint and brand favorability help drive acquisition.","John M.

answer,"Yeah, it appears to us that customer preferences are changing. I mean, much like we see in other businesses, customers aren't necessarily willing to come into a fast casual restaurant, be seated and have a one hour dining experience. They either are going up market to a nicer dining experience if they're going to spend an hour, they want better quality food, better service, or they want things faster, they want things more conveniently. And so they're using Uber Eats or they're using whatever other – having food delivered to their house. Just different preferences I think and lifestyle habits are what's really affected that sector. The other thing is there are lots and lots of brands and choices in that space. I think there probably has been an overabundance of different themes that have been developed over time and I think that's had some pressure on that sector as well.","John M.

answer,"Yeah, the Simplify and Grow was born out of the idea that two years or a year-and-a-half ago or so when we were benefiting from rising rates, we're benefiting from really good credit quality, but that benefit wasn't going to last. The business was changing. We had to find ways to make banking easier, more convenient for our customers. At the same time we believed that efficiency was going to be a really important aspect of the business, we're going to have to become more efficient consistently in order to effectively deliver returns for our shareholders over time. And so we kicked off the Simplify and Grow initiative. It's really about continuous improvement. We want to say it doesn't have a beginning and an end. It really needs to be about how we think about getting better every single day. We initially had 45 strategic initiatives or opportunities identified through Simplify and Grow. In 2018, we completed 12 of those. And I would tell you that we probably saw maybe 20% of the impact of what we think the whole – those 45 initiatives will have on the bank. Last year, we vacated about 700,000 square feet of space. This year, our objective is to vacate another 700,000 square feet of space. 80% of that is non-branch space. So it's a datacenter, it's big buildings that used to be main offices of banks and smaller communities, it's office space and downtown office buildings, where we're currently located. How do we continue to consolidate that and reduce cost and we think there's opportunity to continue doing that. Vendor spend, we reduced by $11 million last year, we think we'll get to over $30 million this year and maybe $60 million by the end of 2021, but that's a continuous effort. Head count, FF&E, branches, all things we continue to work on. Process improvement, I mentioned earlier in the call center we're using artificial intelligence, we've reduced head count by 55. I talked to last night about a smaller thing that we were able to do in the call center using again artificial intelligence for QA function and we reduced head count by 10 people. That's about a $500,000 or $600,000 savings probably, but those things continue to add up and suddenly it becomes $1 million and it's $2 million and it's $10 million. And so, we think there's just a lot of opportunity to continue to improve so 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2019 FactSet CallStreet, LLC that we can make investments in our business and we view it as a cycle of continuous investment. We reduce costs through process improvement, use of technology and then we're able to reinvest. So, more to come there.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF Transcript.pdf
answer,"You've talked about [indiscernible] (00:36:40) so our revenue target for the year is 2% to 4%, that's still intact and relatively stable expenses. And so we're having to overcome the investments on the expense side, overcome the investments we want to make and the natural inflation that we have baked in, merit increases and the like. So if we can continue to do that over the next three years, you can mathematically get to the 55%. We know it's a challenge, we put it in the Investor Day slide knowing it was a challenge, but achievable with a lot of effort. And so, to John's point, staying fixated on continuous improvement. What's exciting about it is, [ph] you just heard of (00:37:22) $500,000 or $600,000 save and you go, $500,000 or $600,000, you guys are $129 billion in assets and whoopee-do. We can get the masses focused on $1 million here and $1 million there, that matters. And that's music to a finance person's ears when $1 million is a lot of money.","David J.

answer,"I would say so and that's a swag but that's my sort of sense of it. Now, remember that we're planning investments that will be financed with some of the savings that we expect. And so our ability to tell you we expect to hold expenses relatively flat is a function of how much progress we make on our Simplify and Grow savings initiatives and revenue initiatives, we have some revenue initiatives that we are in.","John M.

answer,"Well, yes, I mean we're committed to the 55% efficiency ratio. Revenue is an important part of that. And so to the extent we don't get the revenue growth we expect, we may have to lean in a little harder on expenses, but we're committed to get to that number.

unknown,"John M. Turner, Jr. President, Chief Executive Officer, Director & Member-Operating Committee and Executive Council, Regions Financial Corp. Thanks, Jason and thanks all of you for being with us this morning. Look forward to telling a little bit of Region story. We have over the last several years been remixing and de-risking our business, all with the objective to build a business that can be consistently performing, can be sustainable, can be predictable. And we think that we're now in a position to achieve those goals and objectives. If you look at our current profile, we are very much asset sensitive. We enjoy a low cost deposit base. Credit quality has continued to improve. Clearly, our de-risking activities, we believe have positioned us well for the next economic cycle. Capital returns and our capital plan will produce outsized returns to our shareholders and we're excited about our Simplify and Grow initiative because it's designed to structurally change our business in ways that will allow us to better serve our customers, make it easier and simpler for our customers and bankers and at the same time drive consistent efficiencies and effectiveness over time. We enjoy very much a low cost deposit base. It's key to our franchise value. The work we've done over the last number of years to remix our deposit base we think has been transformational. Roughly two-thirds of our customer deposits are retail deposits. They're very granular in nature, very loyal. Half of our customer deposits are held by individuals who have banked with us for more than 10 years. 2 Regions Financial Corp. (RF) Corrected Transcript Barclays Global Financial Services Conference 13-Sep-2018 We benefit from again having most of our customers maintain their primary operating accounts with us that means that these deposits are fairly granular, they are transactional. The average balance is between $3,500 and $5,000. And so, those customer deposits are very much very sticky. Roughly 90% of our customer households maintain what we define as a high quality primary checking account with us. Our consumer checking deposits are comprised largely of demand deposits, of savings deposits and now account deposits, roughly 63% of all consumer deposits fit in one of those three categories, which again help support our very industry leading deposit beta. When you look at our deposit advantage, part of it is driven by the position that we have in a number of our markets we have, high share, in 70% of the markets in our 15 state footprint, we have number five or better market share, and 70% of our deposits are in markets, where we do not have significant money center bank competition. I think that's important to reinforce the point, we're often asked, well, how does the money center banks and the investment they're making in digital affect your deposits. And we will stipulate that we're not competing largely with the money center banks in the markets, where we have again strong deposit share. And again, this supports our industry leading deposit betas. Asset quality has continued to improve. Clearly, we're benefiting from what we think the derisking activities and portfolio shaping that we have done over time. We've made significant investments in our credit risk infrastructure. Our culture is focused on relationships and risk adjusted returns not growth for growth sake, selectivity, sound underwriting and active portfolio management are keys and foundations to our approach. We believe that the work we've done to de-risk our portfolios in multi-family, in medical office building, in energy, in indirect auto as examples have positioned us well for the next credit cycle. We enjoy strong capital levels and robust capital returns. Our capital priorities are unchanged. We'll continue to use our capital to leverage and to finance organic growth. We want to pay a sustainable dividend of 35% to 45% of earnings. We want to make strategic investments over time but I'd be quick to say that bank M&A is not in our near-term future. Today the economics don't favor Regions but more importantly, we think that the near-term opportunities we had to improve our performance through our asset sensitivity, through the work we're doing around Simplify and Grow and through our plan to return capital to shareholders will result in improved performance and should result in an increasing stock price which then will position us in the future to think about bank M&A, today just not an option for us. On the other hand, we've had success with non-bank M&A and we want to continue to make investments in things that will enhance our capabilities, will allow us to meet customer needs and will allow us to grow and diversify revenue, doesn't require a lot of capital but certainly has been, we think beneficial to us. And then finally to the extent that we have capital that is unallocated, we want to return it to our shareholders and as you know, we're in the process of doing that today. We are excited about our Simplify and Grow initiative and we've announced this right around the first of the year. It's about how do we structurally alter our business to make it easier for our customers and bankers to accelerate revenue growth, to create process, improvements that will ultimately result in greater efficiencies and effectiveness. And we believe that we're having some real success. Since the first of the year, we have made some internal organizational changes that will begin to show themselves in terms of the impact they'll have in the third quarter. We executed on the sale of Regions' insurance that will 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2018 FactSet CallStreet, LLC Regions Financial Corp. (RF) Corrected Transcript Barclays Global Financial Services Conference 13-Sep-2018 result in improvements in our efficiency ratio and allow us to focus management attention on where we think we can get a greater return. We have refined our retail network strategy, announced additional closures in our branches and also reduced the number of positions in our branches so that efficiency within our branch network continues to improve. And I think again all-in-all we have about 40 initiatives that are currently underway and you're just beginning to see the benefits of those and we'll see those in the third quarter. About 70% of the initiatives are expense focused, another 30% are revenue focused, we have, as I said, already begun making some improvements, our commercial lending process as a result of changes we have made, turnaround times are 70% better than they were just a year ago. We're working to fully digitize our consumer lending platform. First place we started was in mortgage, [ph] which (08:13) modified the mortgage loan application, reduced the number of questions, customers can now complete that application in about five minutes. And we've seen the adoption of that application increase over the last six months from less than 20% to almost 60%. And largely that's because our mortgage originators are pushing customers that way. They get paid based upon the number of loans that they produce and close and so it tells me that the mortgage loan application changes we've made have been meaningful. We're using artificial intelligence in our call center. We've intercepted 700,000 calls in six months using IBM's Watson product. As a result of that, we've reduced customer wait time by 16,000 hours and the equivalent FTE associated with answering the 700,000 calls is about 55 people. We're using artificial intelligence in our branches to inform our bankers as they're having needs base conversations with our customers about what the next best product is to talk to that customer about, and again we think this is having a positive impact. But it's not just about simplification, we also want to make investments, and so we're hiring bankers across our businesses, commercial, wealth, consumer, capital markets, just hired a new Chief Data Officer to help us importantly with our digital strategy, and we've invested in new systems in commercial banking, treasury management and wealth banking to name a few. It is important that we focus on digital. Digital is impacting our business at an ever increasing rate. We are allocating our investments around digital I think in four key categories. One, we want to improve the customer experience. Two, it's important that we use data and analytics to gain better insights into, who our customers are, what their needs are, and where our opportunities are, where we can market to the next customer. Three, we want to use technology to improve our processes. And four, over time we'll continue to make investments in API as we use outsourcing and the cloud to improve the quality of our overall technology offering. Key to a question we often get is, how are we going to grow? Well, we talked about our dominant share in those core markets that we operate in. We also are in some really fast growing markets, in fact some of the best, the fastest growing markets in the country. You'll see here, we have top five market share in half of these 20 markets and we're making investments in the others, places like Atlanta, Orlando, St. Louis and Houston, where we believe we have an opportunity to grow our business and replicate the kind of deposit base that we currently enjoy across other markets. We're growing today, consumer checking accounts are up 1.2%. Importantly, consumer demand deposits up about 6% year-over-year, consumer savings up 8% year-over-year. I mentioned that roughly half of our consumer deposits are held by customers, who've been with us for more than 10 years. The most common age of an account we're opening today is 18 years and 45% of all the accounts we open, are opened by individuals whose 1-877-FACTSET www.callstreet.com Copyright © 2001-2018 FactSet CallStreet, LLC age is 30 or less. So while we have a very solid loyal customer base, we are also appealing to the younger crowd and that's where we see our future growth opportunities. Commercial banking relationships growing 4%, capital markets revenue up almost 50%, wealth management revenue up 6%. So our business is growing. At the same time, digital adoption is increasing. 55% of our customers are using multiple channels as we think about growth in the future and where we invest, it's got to be across all of our channels because increasingly that's what customers want. They still come into the branches, they call us through the contact center. They use our online mobile platforms and so we'll continue to make those investments. Today, roughly 75% of all of our interactions are digital in nature. So we're excited about our opportunities. We believe in our plan. We're making investments in talent, in technology and capabilities in markets, and we think that provides a real opportunity to grow. We have modified our guidance. We provided that I think late yesterday a couple of points. We expect our return on tangible common equity to be approximately 16% at the upper end of the range that we have provided. We expect deposits to be fairly stable, and what that reflects is growth in consumer offset by run off in our commercial deposits. NII, NIR continue to perform very well. We're affirming our commitment to grow loans, sort of, low-single-digit and to deliver an efficiency ratio of less than 60% for the full year. So with that, I'll stop and we'll take questions. Jason? Corrected Transcript Barclays Global Financial Services Conference 13-Sep-2018 We benefit from again having most of our customers maintain their primary operating accounts with us that means that these deposits are fairly granular, they are transactional. The average balance is between $3,500 and $5,000. And so, those customer deposits are very much very sticky. Roughly 90% of our customer households maintain what we define as a high quality primary checking account with us. Our consumer checking deposits are comprised largely of demand deposits, of savings deposits and now account deposits, roughly 63% of all consumer deposits fit in one of those three categories, which again help support our very industry leading deposit beta. When you look at our deposit advantage, part of it is driven by the position that we have in a number of our markets we have, high share, in 70% of the markets in our 15 state footprint, we have number five or better market share, and 70% of our deposits are in markets, where we do not have significant money center bank competition. I think that's important to reinforce the point, we're often asked, well, how does the money center banks and the investment they're making in digital affect your deposits. And we will stipulate that we're not competing largely with the money center banks in the markets, where we have again strong deposit share. And again, this supports our industry leading deposit betas. Asset quality has continued to improve. Clearly, we're benefiting from what we think the derisking activities and portfolio shaping that we have done over time. We've made significant investments in our credit risk infrastructure. Our culture is focused on relationships and risk adjusted returns not growth for growth sake, selectivity, sound underwriting and active portfolio management are keys and foundations to our approach. We believe that the work we've done to de-risk our portfolios in multi-family, in medical office building, in energy, in indirect auto as examples have positioned us well for the next credit cycle.

question,"QUESTION AND ANSWER Q Yeah. That's helpful. Maybe we could delve a bit more into loan growth. You kind of reiterated your low-to-mid single digit or low single digit rather kind of expectations. Others have been a bit more cautious. Can you talk about kind of where you are seeing that growth, what you're hearing from customers and your outlook on both the commercial side as well as the consumer front?",error,error,error,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Barclays-2018-Transcript.pdf
answer,"So our growth is primarily in commercial. As we completed the second quarter, we saw – beginning to see a nice increase in pipelines. Production was up some 8% and we had nice end of period loan growth that's carried into the third quarter and we're seeing growth really across all of our sectors, growth in both our specialized industries businesses, in wholesale and manufacturing, so our diversified industries groups are growing as well. And it seems to be largely the result of businesses making investments. On the consumer side, when we continue to experience some run off in our equity loan, and our equity line portfolio but we're at the same time growing the indirect business which to a great extent will offset that excluding the planned run-off in indirect auto.","John M.

question,"Okay, fine. Then maybe a bit more in terms of net interest margin and I guess, it has been another area of focus you guys have certainly benefited over the last couple of years [indiscernible] (15:12) asset-sensitive balance sheet. Maybe talk to kind of what you are seeing in current environment, your deposit betas have obviously been better than peers? How do you see those progressing and how do you see NIM behaving given what you said on deposits and the current rate backdrop?",Jason M. Goldberg,Analyst,"Barclays Capital, Inc.",regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Barclays-2018-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah. I'll start and let Deron kind of wrap up. But one of the things we believe has been under appreciated is our deposit base. John walked through a lot of the statistics in terms of our deposit base, very granular, consumer centric deposits. Our betas perform better than we had anticipated. We think the driver is that granularity. This year our deposit beta has been for the year about 22%. We think it will be for the year about 30% which implies the 40% for the back half. So we do think deposit betas will start giving or will be higher than we have seen. Our cumulative beta is 14%, the one of the lowest in the peer group and we think we'll even through the cycle continue to outperform because of the deposit makeup that we have. So that when we talk about asset sensitivity is just not how we structured the balance sheet to actually perform on the short, medium and long end of the curve. But it's really watching that funding base, it's a huge driver. Loan deposit ratio of 84% and while we're having decent loan growth, it hasn't been something we needed to go chase deposits to fund. We think of growing customer accounts to get loans and deposits, not having to go chase funding and that benefits us by being able to keep that cost down. So we see continued growth in NII. We gave you guidance and we expect our margin to continue to expand. We wish 30-day LIBOR would be more beneficial than it appears to be thus far. But a big driver of our outperformance is the fact that we have a lot of reinvestment whether it's fixed rate securities and loans coming off the books, some $14 billion over the next year. About $4 billion of that's securities, about $10 billion of that's loans. So reinvestment picking up another 75 basis points to 100 basis points, that's a huge tailwind for us. Even when the curve is flat, it's flat but higher and so that gives us confidence to give you the kind of guidance we have for NII margin You want to add to that?","David J.

question,"All right. We will pause and take a couple of look at some of our ARS questions and then we'll take some audience questions. So what's your positioning in the stock, overweight, market weight, underweight or no position? So 29% overweight. Last year this time that was only 7%, so lot of happy investors in the room, which is interesting, and go to the next question. If we don't own the stock or underweight which line item you kind of most looking at to change your mind, loan growth, NIM fees, expenses, dividend buyback or valuations. Loan growth aside from valuation is by far the number one response. I guess you talked about a lot of the initiatives already in terms of your outlook there. So I won't press you further. We pause there and see if there's any questions from the audience. I see one back right and she's coming with the mic, so just wait 10 seconds.",Jason M. Goldberg,Analyst,"Barclays Capital, Inc.",regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Barclays-2018-Transcript.pdf
error,"Q Yes. I have a question. So firstly I want to go back in time a little bit to your sale of Morgan Keegan and just reflect on that transaction and the rationale behind that because if you look at the business today, wealth, $8 billion of deposits is growing pretty nicely, you said it's growing 6% right now. And so just kind of a two-pronged question, just reflect on the rationale today looking back on the sale of Morgan Keegan is because it's done pretty well in its transition. And just kind of how you think about growth in the $8 billion of deposits in wealth?",,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Barclays-2018-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Sure. As you said let's go back, made me cringe a bit. In some cases, we don't want to do that. But in the case of Morgan Keegan that's 2012. In 2012, we still had TARP, we needed to simplify our business, we need to raise capital in the cheapest form we could because we didn't want to dilute our shareholders any more than we had to. Morgan Keegan also had a series of litigation issues that we were dealing with. And so simplifying that, getting out, in particular the retail brokerage side of that was just something we struggled with being able to make that work inside of a regulated bank. So we were able to get to – it's about $3.5 billion worth of revenue at the time, we sold it for a little over a $1 billion, is right thing to do. That $1 billion also provided liquidity. So we needed that to help to pay for TARP repayment and other things. So it saved us from having to go get a very expensive debt. Our spread was very wide at the time. So we thought net-net, it was the right thing to do. We still believe it. They were good people, and we're glad they had a good home to go to in the form of Raymond James, and they performed very well for them it appears. But what happened to us in that is, there was a piece of capital markets business on the fixed income side that had to go with the transaction. We kept the trust piece. We had to sell that capital markets piece and that's what we've had to rebuild over time. So you've seen investments that we have made in people and capabilities to serve our larger clients, corporate and commercial clients, and we've had to rebuild. It's taken us some time. And that was really the only disappointment that which we could have kept that piece, but the model wouldn't work breaking them apart. So that was a rationale we thought it was a pretty good decision.","John M.

answer,"I have not been with the bank but about six months, so that wasn't something I knew much about.","David J.

question,"Thanks. Any other questions? Q Hey, wanted to ask you about loan growth again. If I'm looking at the numbers correctly on an average basis adjusted, you grew like 1.1% year-over-year, and it looks like in the period maybe around 1% or a little less. So you've expressed confidence in loan growth being similar, I think to Q2. So are you talking those types of numbers. And if so, that's a little bit less than peers. And I know you guys have run off – your peers have run off too. So I'm just kind of curious given what you said about your geographic footprint being faster growing, but yet your loan growth looks like it trails peers even again trying to adjust for some of the runoff.",Jason M. Goldberg,Analyst,"Barclays Capital, Inc.",regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Barclays-2018-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Yes. So as we look at our expected performance, we don't have to grow a lot to achieve all of our financial objectives, and we do think that at this point – potentially at this point, in the economic cycle and whose to know when the economy may turn. But it's important that we care for, our markets are very competitive. We won – technically won, booked a little over $9 billion in new business through the first six months of the year. But we didn't win about $5.6 billion in wholesale business opportunities during the first six months of the year. And the majority of the reason we didn't win that business, was because of pricing or some other structural element. So we know the opportunity is present but we're not competing on rate, we're not competing on terms and we think it's really important during this period of time to emphasize that as part of the culture that we're continuing to build and create sound risk management. And if we do that, we think it's key to our being a consistent and sustainable performer over time. So we're comfortable with our level of loan growth given where we operate, given the competitive conditions and where we are in the market, we can achieve our financial objectives given where we are.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer, Director & Member-Operating Committee and Executive Council",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Barclays-2018-Transcript.pdf
answer,"I would add to that, if you do a peer comparison as to where the growth came from, that outperformed us in the first half. You'd see that manifest itself in the real estate, commercial real estate. We have not been wanting to grow commercial real estate. We pulled out of Houston, early on. This is when we had energy crisis has hit. We thought there was risk there. We saw real estate risk in Nashville and Charlotte, and Atlanta and so we chose not to participate in that which was different than our peers did and we think that was the right answer for us. We also have been moving from the construction lending to more term lending, stabilized cash flow lending and that took us a little bit of time to transition but our core business we feel very good about as John mentioned.","David J.

unknown,"Q Yeah. I had a follow-up question on the loan growth and your answer describes a great discipline about pricing and structure et cetera. How much of that is also driven perhaps by CCAR and we've heard this answer from a lot of banks that, we just don't want to do those loans, because they're tougher. Is the whole banking sector just 8 more conservative or is there more structural reason, are you running numbers on, if I made that loan, my stress test would get much worse?",error,error,error,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Barclays-2018-Transcript.pdf
answer,"No, I would say, answer to that question two ways. One, we made a commitment now a few years ago to really focus on risk adjusted returns within our business, and to have a better understanding about returns in our businesses, in our products. So we've made choices like the sale of insurance, where we didn't think we were getting an appropriate return on our capital. And so it is one, a reflection of our commitment to returns within businesses, within portfolios, within asset classes, and a discipline that we're continuing to build on. We do make decisions though based upon the information that is reflected back to us through the CCAR process. So as an example, David talked about our desire to reduce the amount of construction lending we were doing and shift our real estate business to being more balanced between construction and term lending that was directly the result of the impact that we saw through the CCAR process of holding a lot of construction loans. There was clearly a capital tax. And so we made a decision to reduce the size of that portfolio, and to begin to grow the term lending business, which is more stable and brings with it deposits and fees and other things that, that are more profitable. So it's really a two-part answer.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer, Director & Member-Operating Committee and Executive Council",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Barclays-2018-Transcript.pdf
answer,"You know, you also have to look at those risk adjusted return manifest itself in decisions like the, not renewing a third-party contract on our indirect auto. The returns were [indiscernible] (27:28) $700 million, so I can appreciate, while others have some run-off portfolios, that's a big number for us. We also sold $254 million for the troubled debt restructured loans again to try to get our returns up and that's a cultural change that we've had over the past several years is we're not about nominal revenue and nominal balance sheet growth, it's about risk adjusted returns to our shareholders because we needed to get our return on tangible [ph] coming up (27:54) and we think you're seeing the benefit of that.","David J.

question,"Additional questions? And we'll go to the next ARS questions. For the audience, what do you think will drive the most benefit from the Simplify and Growth initiative?

question,"States. So, branch and real estate reduction followed by head count elimination. I guess on Simplify and Grow have you, or willing you or going to kind of maybe put out some financial targets for that – I mean you talked about being more geared towards expenses than revenues. But you had your prior [ph] $300 million to $400 million (29:17) type state program which are hard dollar number, I guess how are you conceptually thinking about this program? And when could we hear more about it?",Jason M. Goldberg,Analyst,"Barclays Capital, Inc.",regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Barclays-2018-Transcript.pdf
answer,"We haven't given out any hard dollar targets because we really view it as an effort to change our culture to create a culture of continuous improvement. We don't think about it as a program whether at beginning and in end. But rather it is a different way for us to think about how we do business. We've embedded the impacts that we believe we will experience in our financial targets. And so as you see those targets, you can appreciate achieving the results or in part will be achieved through Simplify and Grow. But we don't intend to put out any specific targets or categorizations because we think that implies a program which might force us to make some decisions to meet targets that we ultimately don't want to be held to. I think as long as we achieve our financial targets, as they've been described, and how we get there, we want to be left to us and we won't be able to control the timing.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer, Director & Member-Operating Committee and Executive Council",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Barclays-2018-Transcript.pdf
answer,"We have given you targets that's part of Simplify and Grow is helping us get to below 60% efficiency ratio. Simplify and Grow will help us get to that mid-50s to lower 50s on efficiency over time. So we haven't given a dollar amount for expense elimination and this manifests itself in the resulting metrics that we see. And you look at what's on the slide there, the first four of those are all embedded in Simplify and Grow. That's the extent of which is perhaps different than what each of you may want, but all of those are being addressed. We do look at all of our states, we like the diversification that we have. Clearly, we don't have share in the same share in some states, as we do in others. But we are making sure all of those are very profitable. And if you get rid of one, you got to redeploy the capital to get the return that we need to have. So those are all very good points and are being addressed in Simplify and Grow.","David J. Turner, Jr.","Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Member-Executive Council and Operating Committee",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Barclays-2018-Transcript.pdf
question,"I guess maybe we'll ask the audience a follow-up question today with the next ARS question. David mentioned the mid-50s kind of [indiscernible] (31:38) efficiency ratio. I guess where do you kind of see Region's kind of long-term efficiency ratio target should be talking about sub-60% this year, mid-50s longer term, throw some choices out to the audience? So [ph] thought that (32:06) mid-50s may have been a little bit higher although you have some people being smart at being sub-52%. I don't know. Dave looks a little bit uncomfortable. In terms of long, long term is, right.",Jason M. Goldberg,Analyst,"Barclays Capital, Inc.",regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Barclays-2018-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Oh you're talking about for – is that a 2019 or is that a three-year, what's ...","David J. Turner, Jr.","Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Member-Executive Council and Operating Committee",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Barclays-2018-Transcript.pdf
question,I was thinking three – I think more like a three-year.,Jason M. Goldberg,Analyst,"Barclays Capital, Inc.",regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Barclays-2018-Transcript.pdf
answer,Yeah.,"David J. Turner, Jr.","Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Member-Executive Council and Operating Committee",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Barclays-2018-Transcript.pdf
question,"And we'll go to the last ARS question for Regions. What do you think is the best incremental use of capital for Regions excluding organic loan growth, key bank acquisitions, non-bank acquisitions, further increase the dividend, further increase the buyback? Not a clear consensus. People want even more buybacks and that is never enough, followed by non-bank acquisitions, which you talked a little bit about earlier. I guess this – it will return a lot of capital this year despite that you still have a lot of capital. I guess, how do you think about utilizing [indiscernible] (33:31) capital on the face of an evolving CCAR? And just borrowing more than you need?",Jason M. Goldberg,Analyst,"Barclays Capital, Inc.",regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Barclays-2018-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Now that's a great question. We've developed over the years a very good capital planning regime. We had a lot of people that worked on it, Deron's team drives it. And we don't set capital targets based on what a third party regulator or otherwise would tell us. We've said it based on the amount of capital, we think we need have to run our business and our job is to optimize that capital both in total and the components of the stack. And so we are working to become more efficient. We've been solving Tier 1 with too much common. We're going to rectify that over time and get our common equity Tier 1. Our math tells us we ought to be in the 9.5% range which we're seeking to get to in 2019. We're going to call it 11% right now. So a point and half, that's a $1.5 billion in real math, that we need to return to shareholders. So we hope we get some relief not because it will change the capital targets, but it will change how timely we can manage our capital levels, that is repurchases really ought to be the last thing that we do. We ought to be putting our capital work for our shareholders to grow. But when the growth opportunities aren't there then you give it back and not let it pile up and hurt your return. So we're excited about getting that ability to manage more real time, and – but 9.5% is kind of the common equity Tier 1 target that we currently have.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer, Director & Member-Operating Committee and Executive Council",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Barclays-2018-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah, I would just comment on the dividend. Obviously, this year we had a pretty robust increase in the dividend and the way we think about that primarily is we want to set the dividend in a level that we think is sustainable through what I would call a normal cycle, so a normal downturn. And as John's talked about our efforts over the last few years to make sure we're getting paid for the risk we're taking to de-risk in certain places, to grow revenue streams that we think are more stable through the cycle. That all contributes to greater stability and earnings and lower variability in earnings. And so, I think over time, we believe we can get the dividend payout ratio. Obviously, the dividend will grow commensurate with earnings, but we also think the payout ratio can grow toward the upper end of that 35% to 45% range as we continue to grow those businesses that contribute to stability and earnings, and we manage the variability of the credit risk in the balance sheet.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer, Director & Member-Operating Committee and Executive Council",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Barclays-2018-Transcript.pdf
question,"And maybe I know in several years this conference we've talked about the impact of hurricanes and how that [indiscernible] (36:30). It looks like in the next couple, we'll likely miss the most of your franchise, but can you just remind us in terms of how the impact of hurricanes plays through in terms of what you initially see from a credit loss perspective, and a deposit inflow perspective and rebuilding? Can you just remind us how investors should think about that for some of these other markets? Just to go around.",Jason M. Goldberg,Analyst,"Barclays Capital, Inc.",regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Barclays-2018-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah. So, we do have branches in the current path. Our teams are busy right now in going zip code by zip code in terms of what we do have and how it might get impacted, whether it be from wind or flooding. So we do go through that. What happens is generally there is destruction of some form. Sometimes insurance covers it, sometimes it doesn't. They are generally speaking early on, there are more losses, but then you have a period of time where there is a lot of infrastructure spending to kind of rebuild that and lending opportunity to these come out of that too. But early on our job is to take our customer base and make sure they're taken care of. They have cash needs. When you lose electricity and you've been flooded and you need cash to – it becomes the cash economy very quickly. So we'll dispense our mobile units to get down to the affected area, so that our customers can get back as quickly as they can to normal life and get cash in their pocket, help businesses get open because every day they are closed or losing money. Hopefully it's insured. But that's really how we see it. And over time it creates opportunity. You saw that in Houston where we pulled back from commercial real estate and then there was a hurricane. There was a lot building that came after that.","David J. Turner, Jr.","Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer & Member-Executive Council and Operating Committee",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Barclays-2018-Transcript.pdf
answer,"But within 60 days to 90 days, you'll see an increase in deposits and then economic activity will pick up as rebuilding occurs. So it's eventually will create a dynamic in the market that will be good for business. Always a human tragedy associated with that. So you never wish for a hurricane but there is a positive business impact typically as a result, I think that was the nature of the question.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer, Director & Member-Operating Committee and Executive Council",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Barclays-2018-Transcript.pdf
question,"Okay. Maybe time for one more last question from the audience. I guess John I appreciate you have been with the banks seven years but you've only been CEO for 75 days or so. Maybe talk to kind of any initial impressions, surprises anything you want to see done differently as you kind of look out?",Jason M. Goldberg,Analyst,"Barclays Capital, Inc.",regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Barclays-2018-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah. I would say impressions, I'm more optimistic about our future than I was before I was the CEO, not because I'm the CEO but because I've had a chance to spend time in our markets with our teams. I think we've got a really solid plan I like the trajectory that we're on. And so, I would say my impressions are really informed by the commitment of our team, the reaction to the changes associated with Simplify and Grow, they're excited about our plans and the things that we're doing to make our business stronger.","John M.

question,"Maybe I'll kick it off, John. You've now been in the job for about six months. How are things going so far? Any big surprises and as you go around to meet people across the company, what are you most excited for at the bank?",Ryan M. Nash,Analyst,Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Goldman-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Well, thank you. Thanks for having us here. First, a number of months have gone great. Grayson was a super leader and he really did a good job, I think, positioning the company well. He has been great to work with through the transition, had been a very good mentor so transition has gone as well as it might. I'm excited about the quality of our teams, about our plans. I mentioned being well-positioned. We enjoy asset sensitivity, which we think we'll continue to benefit from. Credit quality is good. We have a super plan to continue to return capital to shareholders and our continuous improvement initiative we call Simplify and Grow, we think has already produced some significant results and we have a lot of opportunity in the future to continue to improve. So, our teams are excited about it. I feel the energy as I get around to visit with markets and our bankers and I think we have a very bright future so I'm excited about that opportunity.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Goldman-Transcript.pdf
question,"John, you referenced Simplify and Grow, I want to maybe start with the Simplify part of the equation. We've seen a handful of actions, including selling the insurance business. You exited some higher risk loans and you've reduced head count by over 1,500 positions. You've accelerated brands cut. Can you talk about the key initiatives that you have underway to simplify the organization, help improve the efficiency over time?",Ryan M. Nash,Analyst,Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Goldman-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah. We've recently made some organizational changes that reduced through the spans and layers of exercise, reduced some layers of management. We realigned our businesses to create more clear lines of responsibility and accountability, improve communication and execution and we're already beginning to see the benefits of some of that. Going forward, we've got to focus on how do we make banking easier for our customers? How do we use technology to improve efficiency and processes and we're doing things like digitizing the consumer loan process and converting our – or simplifying our mortgage loan application so that it's easier for customers to use it. They get a quicker response and so we have both the benefit of reducing time to complete an application and also giving a customer a faster response, which has both the revenue and expense impact. So, as we think about how do we improve our opportunities going forward, largely are how do we improve our processes to make it easier and to create efficiency.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Goldman-Transcript.pdf
question,"[Technical Difficulty] (00:03:45-00:03:50) roughly 30% of your initiatives are revenue-driven and I guess part of that is just improving processes, but can you talk about what the key pieces are? Whether it's like you said, digitizing, optimizing delivery channels? What are going to be the biggest contributors to driving your growth [indiscernible] (00:04:09)?",Ryan M. Nash,Analyst,Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Goldman-Transcript.pdf
answer,"So, in our branches as an example, we've recently reduced some of the functions that the branches had to do and as a result we've created about 500,000 man hours that had previously been dedicated to other job. We've eliminated paper, so we eliminated 5 million pieces of paper in the branches. Working with our commercial bankers, improving our loan approval process, we've reduced turnaround times from nine days to two. And what that does it allows us to get back to a customer much more quickly with an answer and so it has significant revenue impact. Also looking to reduce the various responsibilities of our bankers so that we can centralize functions, allow them to spend more time with customers and be more effective in the execution of their particular role, which again has a revenue impact and we're seeing that through better pull-through in our pipelines and execution of our sales management activities, which has resulted in the loan growth.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Goldman-Transcript.pdf
question,"The last comments, better pull-through in your pipelines. I think last quarter you had linked-quarter annualized growth of almost 7%. I think it's the highest level in any quarter in 10 years. I don't want to extrapolate any one quarter...",Ryan M. Nash,Analyst,Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Goldman-Transcript.pdf
answer,Yeah.,"John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Goldman-Transcript.pdf
question,"... but that's [indiscernible] (00:05:23) we've seen industry loan growth improve recently, can you just talk about what you guys are seeing on the lending side and do you think this can continue as we've got continued momentum to 2019?",Ryan M. Nash,Analyst,Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Goldman-Transcript.pdf
answer,"So we're – I think we've guided towards low-single-digit kind of 2% to 4% loan growth for the year after adjustment for runoff in dealer indirect portfolio that we've previously identified as an exit and also our TDR sale. We're seeing good growth in C&I, and I think that is the result of a couple things: One is a better focus on client selectivity and the things that are in the pipeline, so better pipeline management, faster turnaround times. We are seeing more activity in our markets. I would say our economies are good. They're not great but they're good. Customer feedback is positive. Customers are making more investments in their business, so we're seeing more opportunities. Similarly, on the real estate side, we've been making a transition from being largely a construction lender to one with greater balance between construction and term. We've finally gotten some traction there and so we are growing the term portfolio and that contributed to loan growth. And importantly, we had created a lot of internal headwinds just through the derisking activities that we had undertaken over the previous two-and-a-half years or so. And as a result, that was a real – had a negative impact on growth. Since we have completed those derisking activities largely, we have begun to see the growth that we expected in the second, third and likely in the fourth quarter.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Goldman-Transcript.pdf
question,"I guess just on the back of that comment regarding derisking. I think about the different potential drivers of growth. I believe you guys have the GreenSky point-of-sale partnership. You're getting, I think, close to the limit that you wanted to have on your balance sheet but on the flip side as you said investor real estate, I think, has reached – you said it's reached the bottom. So what would you expect would be the main drivers?",Ryan M. Nash,Analyst,Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Goldman-Transcript.pdf
answer,"So, we'll continue to grow C&I, that's a core capability for us and we'll lean into many of our specialized groups – whether it be our specialized lending groups, tech and defense, healthcare, power utilities, energy, those types of things. We will grow our investor real estate book kind of with the economy, maybe plus a little. It has declined to the second lowest level amongst, I think, all of our peers and so we think it's appropriate to grow it prudently, carefully. That business is built around again real estate professional that we're – only our specialists are making investor real estate loans. We feel good about the business and there are lots of ancillary benefits associated with it. On the consumer side, we'll continue to grow mortgage a bit. We like that business. We are investing in mortgage loan originators and continuing to invest in our platform. So those are some places where I think you'd see some growth.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Goldman-Transcript.pdf
question,"One of the key parts to invest in Regions is in the quality of deposit base and I think cycle to-date, your beta has been around 14% or 15%. I think just over 20% for the most recent hike versus peers, cumulatively are in the 25 percentage point range. I think you recently commented that you didn't expect this gap to widen much further. Can you maybe just talk about what your expectations are for deposit betas, both retail and commercial as we look at it?",Ryan M. Nash,Analyst,Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Goldman-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Sure. So if you look at our cumulative beta, most of that beta has been driven really by the commercial side, so about 46% of the consumer is in the low-single digit. What we're trying to convey is we've outperformed as we expected and maybe a little better early on. And so we were trying to guide to the next increase and having to pass through that 40% to 60% of that next increase which we think maybe a little better than what peers do, but it won't be at the magnitude that we've had thus far. We still believe, through the cycle, we'll outperform and that cycle we think is a Fed funds of 3% to 3.5%. If you apply those factors, then that cumulative beta at that time is in the 35% range. So I think the market misunderstood how the cumulative beta, through the cycle, being in the 60% range where, mathematically, it would be hard to get at, so it's more of a cumulative 35%.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Goldman-Transcript.pdf
question,"So just to clarify, the 35% cumulative and the 40% to 60% potentially on incremental hikes and, I guess, related to that, where do you think – even with that outlook, where do you think the net interest margin could eventually get to as we get to more normalized levels of rates there?",Ryan M. Nash,Analyst,Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Goldman-Transcript.pdf
answer,Yes. So we've talked about that our long-term normalized range for the margin is in the 350 to 370 range. We laid that out probably 25 basis points ago on the margin. So now we have achieved the lower end of that range. I think getting to 370 over time is certainly a possibility. It does require that we continue to have a growing economy and the rate environment continues to modestly normalize. We don't need a lot from here to get that but we certainly need – we need a stable economy and stable rate.,"David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Goldman-Transcript.pdf
question,You've been able to grow households at 1.5% clip year-to-date but yet we are seeing shrinkage in the deposit base. Let's talk about what's driving the deposit outflows? What decisions you had made strategically and how you think that could change as we go further into the cycle?,Ryan M. Nash,Analyst,Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Goldman-Transcript.pdf
answer,"I'll start and let Deron talk a little bit about non-interest-bearing. But early on where our loan growth was, we looked at our loan deposit ratio, the low 80% range. We had some deposits in our trust area – Wealth Management area that were more expensive deposits. As a fiduciary, it's incumbent upon us to make sure we get the best rate given the risk profile of the customer. At one time, Regions was paying that rate. We made a strategic decision not to do that. Others were paying a higher rate though, so our fiduciary, our trust offshore removed those funds into another money market fund as an example. That was a few – a couple of billion dollars actually over time and we think that to the extent we ever needed to get that funding back, we call the trust, offer we pay up where the market is and get the deposits back but we didn't need that with the loan growth where it was and [indiscernible] (00:12:17) loan-deposit ratio. So we've also had some shifts in the mix, and Deron, I want you to talk a little bit about that.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Goldman-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah. Sure. And just to further point on David's last comment, many of those deposits that we've chosen to let seek a better alternative off the balance sheet required collateralization. And so when you think about our strategy for funding the balance sheet, we have seen opportunities to reach into the debt market. As you know, Ryan, we have one of the lowest debt levels of our peer group and so improvements in our ratings, improvements in our spreads have allowed us to raise debt at the margin – at levels that are as attractive as some of those more market-based funding sources through deposits and free up our collateral. So we've been able to meet the growth needs on the balance sheet and free up collateral which improves the liquidity position going forward.",Deron Smithy,Executive Vice President & Treasurer,Regions Bank,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Goldman-Transcript.pdf
answer,"The only thing I'd add to that is if you look at where the real value in the Regions franchise is in our core consumer deposit base, 67% of our deposits – number of deposits and if you look at year-over-year growth in the third quarter, consumer demand grew almost 6%, consumer savings grew about 8%. So, we look at that and say our core business, checking accounts growing 1.5% and core consumer operational deposits growing between 6% and 8% and we think that's an awfully strong message around our ability to raise the deposit.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Goldman-Transcript.pdf
question,"I guess, last question for me regarding raising asset sensitivity. David, I think one of the more misunderstood things is just what's going on, on the asset side of the balance sheet given how much fixed rate assets you have repricing. Could you just talk about what that could mean for the margin over time? And second, obviously we've seen the curve flatten a lot, maybe Deron, can you talk about the different sensitivities across the curve...",Ryan M. Nash,Analyst,Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Goldman-Transcript.pdf
answer,Sure.,Deron Smithy,Executive Vice President & Treasurer,Regions Bank,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Goldman-Transcript.pdf
question,...and if we stay in a prolonged period of flat rates?,Ryan M. Nash,Analyst,Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Goldman-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah. So, we have – if you look at our loans, 50% of those, this is adjusted for derivatives, 50% of those are floating, so they'll move with the market. We have – when you look at fixed rate loans and securities that will be cash flow and prepay are paying off, rolling off this year. It's about $14 billion that we'll be rolling off over the next 12 months, reinvested in whatever the rate environment is at that time. Before the last two days, it would have been somewhat higher. We'll see what it is when all that starts to happen. It's pretty linear as we go through the year. So, we have a tailwind of repricing up that we don't have to have rates. This is a whole lot from here. That would be an added benefit. And just so everybody realize our rate expectations are a December increase, one in the summer and one in the following December is kind of what our base case is right now.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Goldman-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah. So just following on that last comment. That level of reinvestment is really – even at current levels, it's positive. And so, obviously we're hoping for a little higher rates over the next year than where we are today. But over the last couple of quarters, we've seen that reinvestment rate be as high as 100 basis points higher than what's rolling off. Over time, that gap narrows but what that will do is allow us even in an environment where the Fed does take a pause and rates sort of hover in this area. We can still see net interest income growth from here, both as the balance sheet re-prices but also as we continue to grow the earning asset base.",Deron Smithy,Executive Vice President & Treasurer,Regions Bank,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Goldman-Transcript.pdf
question,"John, you're going to be hosting your Investor Day in February where I'm sure we're going to get a lot more details on, not only 2019 but the three years ahead. And one of the things you and David have talked about is just a plan to get to a mid-50, can you just high-level talk through the moving pieces in terms of your expectations of how we would actually achieve that?",Ryan M. Nash,Analyst,Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Goldman-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah. I mean there's obviously a revenue and an expense component. We believe we can continue to grow revenue and we'll do that through the various initiatives that we have underway, the investments that we're making. On the other side, we've got to continue to drive our business to be more efficient. I think 55 or mid-50s is very attainable and something beyond that may equally be attainable in the future as we think about how do we continue to improve. And so that's about, again, improving processes, it's about looking at everything we do, it's about using technology to help shift transactions from our more expensive channels to our lesser expensive channels and we see that occurring every day as customers are preferring mobile and online versus branches for various things. So we've got to look at every aspect of what we do. That's part of our continuous improvement initiative that we call Simplify and Grow. We think it's a key strategic component of how we achieve the financial results we expect to deliver for our shareholders.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Goldman-Transcript.pdf
question,"Here's to credit, if you think about the past quarter, there were a handful of different hiccups across the industry – commercial real estate, some concerns around personal lending. I guess a two-part question. Can you first talk about what you're seeing within your portfolios? I think you had one or two credits that were idiosyncratic that you do have a charge-off this quarter. And then second, the markets are clearly signaling to us that they're concerned about a downturn. Can you just talk about why you think Regions is very different today than it was 10 years ago particularly in areas like CRE?",Ryan M. Nash,Analyst,Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Goldman-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah. So starting with the current portfolio, we have had some concerns about a particular segment within the restaurant sector, fast casual primarily and we've seen a little deterioration in that portfolio and we have specialized bankers who've been in the industry a long time managing that closely. We continue to keep an eye on the healthcare space, ACA. There are clear winners and losers. And so how is that transitioning? Our energy book continues to improve. We've got a couple of legacy credits and primarily in oilfield services that we're still working through but otherwise in good shape; criticized or classified non-performing loans continue to decline and we believe credit quality is really solid. I don't see anything on the consumer side within our portfolio that gives us any concern and so we feel good about where credit is. Going back to the crisis, one of the greatest lessons we learned was the importance of balance and diversity. And we have been committed – are committed to strong concentration methodology and so what makes us different is we have a whole different team of people, we have a whole different approach to the business, we're focused on client selectivity; on sound underwriting, quality credit servicing. We have specialists who are doing specialized business. I mentioned that about real estate, technology, defense and other things, we certainly understand, learned the need and the benefit to ensure that we have the right people in the right place. We've been very focused on risk-adjusted returns in the business. So, as an example, we haven't grown our Shared National Credit exposure effectively for three years because – and what we saw was that we were growing that business and it just wasn't very profitable. So, we forced our bankers to recycle capital within that portfolio and as a result, we improved risk-adjusted returns by over 250 basis points. We just have a better quality business. The overall credit quality is better. The relationships that we have are better, so that relationship-focused, risk-adjusted returns, client selectivity – all those things, we're not interested in growth for growth sake. We want to build a business that's consistently performing and sustainable, and credit is a key element in all of that.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Goldman-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Ryan, I'll add to it and talk about investor real estate. When we put two banks together in 2006 right before the crisis, we had 30% of our loan book was in investor real estate, a lot of land, lot of real estate. Florida and Georgia are two of the hardest hit states of the country. Today, our investor real estate is some 7% of our loan book, very diversified both geographically and in the products. So, we learned a hard lesson and that concentration risk management is a critical component of how we manage risk portfolio.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Goldman-Transcript.pdf
question,Okay. You guys have been one of the most aggressive banks in terms of returning capital [Technical Difficulty] (00:21:19-00:21:21) I think you're well on your way in reaching that at some point in 2019. Let's talk about how you think about capital prioritization from here and how do you think about buybacks versus dividends just given what the markets are telling us and what will be a level you'd like to [indiscernible] (00:21:35) get to?,Ryan M. Nash,Analyst,Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Goldman-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah. So, we started out with a 4.5% in terms of common equity tier 1, we layer on 250 basis points for our buffer to get to a limit at 7%. It's kind of where we want never to breach so that we don't have to worry about having the dividend or other things. And so from that, we add in our individual risks as we see our portfolio changing. So, today that math after we adjust a little bit, points to about 9.5%. We're at 10.1%, we're going to get to 9.5% we believe in 2019, and we've been working that down as we mentioned quite nicely. So we think it's important to optimize capital. We get a lot of questions on could we operate at a lower level of capital. We think 9.5% is a good spot for us and if we have a little extra there to take advantage of lending opportunities should they come and spreads widen out, then that's going to be good for us if we can maybe grow disproportionate if the economy changes. So we think 9.5% is exactly our [ph] hotspot (00:22:54).","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Goldman-Transcript.pdf
question,"We had a handful of banks that give, let's say maybe 9% or 10% and both of them had a pretty sanguine outlook on M&A. I'm curious on your updated thoughts. You think you need to do M&A to achieve scale? Are you happy to stay at the same size? What are your updated thought on traditional banks?",Ryan M. Nash,Analyst,Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Goldman-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah. Today, we have, let me back up – M&A is disruptive, M&A is challenging and we think we have enough near-term leverage today, with our asset sensitivity, with our plan to return capital to shareholders, and with all the improvements we think we can make through Simplify and Grow. We want to focus on those things. Today, the economics don't favor banks our size acquiring other banks given where banks we might acquire trade, ad so we're not interested in bank M&A. Our focus has got to be on how do we continue to improve our operation? How do we continue to improve Regions Bank? If we do that, then we believe the value of our currency comes up, then we're more better positioned to potentially make an acquisition if we had interest. But I think that's some time away and we've got to first earn the right to be an acquirer and to do that, I think we've got to continue to improve.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Goldman-Transcript.pdf
question,"And I guess when you think about M&A, the success that you have had, had been doing some bolt-on fee deals, so I guess a two-part question: First, you guys have had good success growing the fee income to share, particularly capital markets. As you look ahead, what do you see some of the key drivers of your fee income growth? And second, what capabilities on the fees side would you still like to enhance that you could potentially do so with a bolt-on acquisition?",Ryan M. Nash,Analyst,Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Goldman-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah. So those acquisitions have been successful. They have been a catalyst for growth in fee income and we want to continue to try to pursue them. And I should have made that distinction between bank and non-bank when I said we're not interested in acquisitions. Maybe that was implied and I think we'll continue to see growth in fee income on the consumer side as accounts grow. We see that correlation and we believe it will continue to exist. On the wholesale side of the business, we want to make investments – continue to make investments in capital markets to improve our capabilities to allow us to meet unmet customer needs and we think that's important on things like fixed income sales and trading that we're building out. We could accelerate our ability to deliver that through an acquisition potentially. And so that's important; leasing potentially at some sort of equipment finance as those type of companies become available, we're always looking. In Wealth Management, we think there are opportunities – whether it'd be through an institutional money management, through Institutional Services. We have some niche businesses in Wealth that we think we can add to, so we're consistently looking and then we like the mortgage business. And so, we've acquired mortgage servicing rights. We'll continue to do that. I think that will be important part of our future as well.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Goldman-Transcript.pdf
question,"David, I want to shift to talk a little bit about regulation. There are some proposed regulatory changes that should benefit the industry, no longer being subject to the LCR and less frequent inclusion in CCAR. Can you talk about what these potential changes could mean for both the way you manage cash flow and liquidity going forward? Deron, any thoughts you may have to share?",Ryan M. Nash,Analyst,Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Goldman-Transcript.pdf
answer,Sure.,Deron Smithy,Executive Vice President & Treasurer,Regions Bank,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Goldman-Transcript.pdf
answer,"So, we are encouraged by the NPR that came out. I think it's in the latter part of January, we'll have to submit responses and it will probably be in the spring before we hear back but we're encouraged by that. One of the key questions we have is are we going to be able to manage capital more freely and be able to toggle when – because today we have to make assumptions about what 9 quarter or at least one year will look like and things change. And so we need to be able to adapt and overcome whatever change there is. So, we're encouraged by moving in that direction. We might have an off-cycle this year in terms of CCAR, but none of that changes the capital level we need to have. That is our calculation based on our risk profile and it gets back to the previous question that 9.5% that we talked about. There are some benefits that could come out of LCR. We do have some securities in our book to help us from the high-quality liquid asset calculation; Ginnie Mae securities, to be exact and perhaps we could get those to be deployed in a more meaningful manner or deleverage to come degree. So, there's some incremental benefit. I wouldn't say it's a tremendous benefit, but it's all positive, moving in the direction we want.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Goldman-Transcript.pdf
question,"I guess my follow up would be Deron, do you think that to the point that David said regarding deleveraging would this give you an opportunity, if at all, change about the way the construct of the balance sheet potentially, your securities portfolio have gone from 13% or 14% of that that's all the way up to the mid-20s and you guys have obviously have to add debt.",Ryan M. Nash,Analyst,Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Goldman-Transcript.pdf
answer,Sure.,Deron Smithy,Executive Vice President & Treasurer,Regions Bank,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Goldman-Transcript.pdf
question,Do you think the structure of the balance sheet could change at all?,Ryan M. Nash,Analyst,Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Goldman-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Definitely. I think it can over time. As David mentioned, initially just redeploying within the securities portfolio could give us a nice marginal benefit but I think, over time, it's important to step back and understand the LCR for us was a bigger requirement than our own internal stress test. So we've got a process that we built based on our own historical experiences and that would tell us that we need to manage to a slightly lower level of excess liquidity. And so not being subject to the LCR would free up $3 billion to $5 billion over time that we can redeploy in one manner or another, and I think some of that could find its way certainly into better alternatives in the loan book as well. So, I think you could see the size of the securities portfolio be modestly smaller over time as a percentage of total assets.",Deron Smithy,Executive Vice President & Treasurer,Regions Bank,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Goldman-Transcript.pdf
question,Total assets.,Ryan M. Nash,Analyst,Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Goldman-Transcript.pdf
answer,Yeah.,Deron Smithy,Executive Vice President & Treasurer,Regions Bank,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Goldman-Transcript.pdf
question,"David, you've been a spokesman for the industry on CECL and I know you're part of the letter that was sent to FASB. We had one of your competitors at a recent Investor Day show the potential impact in both normal and stress times which was I think, eye opening for a lot of us. So, I'm curious on your thoughts on where we are in terms of the FASB potentially commissioning a study and what impact do you think this could have if it goes through as is?",Ryan M. Nash,Analyst,Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Goldman-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Well, we are encouraged with, as you mentioned, the white paper that about 21 of us sent in to the FASB and copied regulators and SEC and so forth trying to take a standard that enhance where we are today. So the CECL framework is better than where we are today, but it has some unintended consequences that we saw as a result of our modeling that we continue to do. And so we wanted to offer up an alternative which would provide what FASB and investors really wanted, which was more transparency over a life of loan losses. And so we're trying to get a component part of that through the P&L and then the rest of that through other comprehensive income. So, we have full transparency on capital but that we don't take a charge all the way through the income statement for assets that have a lot of duration and for which you would make much money. And so the pro-cyclicality that we've been concerned about has been in times of trouble. Are you going to be encouraged to put a loan on the books – mortgage loan on the books in particular knowing that you're going to have to reserve some extended period of losses day one and the revenue comes later. So, if you – we're going to all be in capital preservation mode in times of trouble and that's the pro-cyclicality that we talk about. So we're encouraged by where they're going. We're in current dialogue with FASB on potential solution. So, it's too early to say we'll have a change but they are listening and we're encouraged by that.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Goldman-Transcript.pdf
question,"[indiscernible] (00:31:17) thing that was talked a lot about yesterday was just technology and technology investing. You have lots of technology initiatives going on across the bank to optimize distribution and costs. I guess can you talk about what are some of the biggest initiatives you're undertaking on right now, I think David when you presented at a conference recently, you talked about being a fast follower versus the big banks. Can you maybe give us examples of what parts of the organization you can actually be a fast follower and where do you actually need to be on equal footing?",Ryan M. Nash,Analyst,Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Goldman-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah. So we think about technology investments in four dimensions. The first is how do we make it easier for our customers. And so that's things like mobile banking, like online banking, the introduction of Zelle, which we just released last Thursday to our customers. How do we make it easier for our customers and that's where we will be a fast follower on product and innovation. We'll also participate with the industry; Zelle would be an example of that where we're riding the coattails of the industry investments. The second dimension is around data and analytics and how do we use data and analytics to better market to our customers and we've developed a platform that we're using successfully that helps our call center bankers and our branch bankers with the next best solution as they talk to their customers and think about the various customer needs that they have when the customer is on the phone or the customers is in front of them, so it's an automated process, it's been very, very, helpful. The third would be artificial intelligence and we're deploying artificial intelligence in our BSA/AML area, in our call center. In the call center, in particular, as a result of the way we're using the IBM Watson product, through the first six months of implementation, we'd intercepted over 700,000 calls, successfully executing around those and the equivalent man hours that were effectively reduced was about 55 FTE. So we see the benefits of that technology and think it's – that we can continue to use and expand it. And the fourth is our core systems, using cloud, API and other technologies to continue to enhance the way we operate the bank. So those four dimensions are where we'll be investing on a consistent go-forward basis.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Goldman-Transcript.pdf
question,And you guys haven't actually disclosed the number around technology spend but would you say you're generally in the ballpark [indiscernible] (00:33:35)?,Ryan M. Nash,Analyst,Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Goldman-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Yeah. We think as we look at what others are saying, we're spending, as a percentage of revenue, what we think others are on a relative basis and given our size, we think that's an appropriate spend and we are comfortable that we can keep up and be very competitive.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Goldman-Transcript.pdf
question,"One of the topic I wanted to hit on Deron, we talked about this last night at dinner, non-interest-bearing deposits you guys obviously over an extended period of time have seen a lot of growth as a percentage of the deposit base. The market has obviously been concerned about the fact that we could see significant outflows?",Ryan M. Nash,Analyst,Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Goldman-Transcript.pdf
answer,Sure.,Deron Smithy,Executive Vice President & Treasurer,Regions Bank,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Goldman-Transcript.pdf
question,Can you talk about why you think that assumption maybe wrong and maybe just give us some of the puts-and- takes within your portfolio?,Ryan M. Nash,Analyst,Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Goldman-Transcript.pdf
answer,"Sure, Ryan. I think that's a – it's a good story for us and it's really a function of our strategy is our first goal is to grow households grow relationships and at the heart of that relationship is the checking account. And so we've had good success over the last 10 years at growing relationships continuously and getting operating accounts, both on the consumer side and on the commercial side. So the growth for us has been really across the board. Roughly 30% of that growth has come in the consumer side. And this similar amount in small business and then a smaller amount in commercial, maybe 20% in commercial. So it's not concentrated in any one spot, number one. And it's really a function of good account growth and improving on the consumer side, improving earnings for consumers as wages have gone up over – over the last several years. And so it's a combination of a lot of hard work focusing on getting the operating accounts and it's not overly concentrated in any one part of our business.",Deron Smithy,Executive Vice President & Treasurer,Regions Bank,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF-Goldman-Transcript.pdf

question,"Great. Thank you, John. I guess you mentioned low- to mid-single-digit loan growth for 2019. On the earnings call, you kind of were talking, too, about low-single-digit loan growth for the year. And you're kind of, I guess, reluctant at that point to update it. I guess maybe just talk to kind of what caused kind of the increase to be maybe a little bit higher and then kind of where you're kind of seeing the strength.",Jason M. Goldberg,Analyst,"Barclays Capital, Inc.",regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF.pdf
answer,"Yes. So, out of the gate, I think we said loan growth in the first quarter – fourth and first quarter was a little faster than we anticipated. It was broad-based. We really saw it across all of our businesses and portfolios. Our line utilization was up fairly dramatically, particularly relative to the first quarter of prior years. And as we enter the quarter and thought about what that meant for the balance of the year, it became pretty apparent that if loans didn't grow any more through the year that we'd probably still going to deliver somewhere between low- and mid- single-digit loan growth. And so, as a result of that, we have modified our expectations. We're still going to manage loan growth carefully. I think we perform best when loans grow at about the pace of our core deposits. And what you saw in the first quarter was because we had a little unexpected loan growth, actually, loans grew faster than core deposits and so we funded that loan growth with more expensive deposits and that's not where we perform best. And so, we want to continue to optimize our business, continue to optimize the quality of our loan portfolio and our deposit base, and we will do that through the balance of the year. So, growth will likely be a little more measured, but we do believe in that kind of low- to mid-single digit range.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF.pdf
question,"I guess – helpful. And then, I guess, in the first quarter, right, we did see an uptick in deposit costs as you funded maybe stronger-than-expected loan growth. So, maybe talk to kind of deposit outlook from here. Do you have the ability to kind of replace some of those more expensive deposits? And, I guess, one of the themes coming out of the conference was just the kind of continued uptick in deposit costs despite the fact that the Fed is on hold, given you maybe have a better deposit base than others, are you seeing a similar trend with that?",Jason M. Goldberg,Analyst,"Barclays Capital, Inc.",regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF.pdf
answer,"Yeah. So, Jason, the first quarter, as John mentioned, we had loan growth a little quicker than we thought. So, we had decisions how we were going to fund that. We could have done it wholesale. We could have done it with cash flows from the securities book. We could have gone back to our customers and given them an opportunity with their excess cash to earn a little better yield, and that's what we chose. That drove our deposit beta up quite a bit in the quarter. We thought that was the cheapest, best alternative for us. We don't see that kind of loan growth happening. As John mentioned, we want to get our core deposit growth coming along to help fund. Your question on deposit costs, so we have a really good deposit franchise. We expect two things to happen; one, not to be as dependent on those deposits that I just mentioned, those higher-cost deposits to fund loan growth. At the same time, history has told us that deposit costs continue to increase about 12 months after the last tightening. So, last tightening, December, so you should see a little bit of pressure on that. It diminishes over time. Part of that comes from mix change. You should continue to see some mix coming out of NIB into interest- bearing checking and that will be a bit of a driver. But all that considered and loan growth and everything that we just talked about, we still feel confident that, for the year, we have a net interest margin in the 3.50% range. In the first quarter we were 3.53%, down a couple of points. As John mentioned, that will continue to have pressure on early part of this next quarter and then, at the back end of the year, pick back up a little bit. As you've heard us talk at Investor Day, because our core, our low-cost deposit base, that creates a little bit more asset sensitivity for us. So, we have to enter into hedges that help protect us and we've put a lot of hedges on forward starting that began in 2020. So, we didn't have as much protection on 2019 and the reason for that is we believe, and still do, that a rate cut in 2019 is not likely. But as the economy continues to slow down, our expectations slow down, we would have some protection in 2020, 2021 and so forth to protect our net interest margin and that's what the 3.40% to 3.70% net-ish margin range is all about, taking out the volatility. So, from quarter to quarter, you could see some anomalies but we're really focusing on the year.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF.pdf
question,"Helpful. Yesterday, BB&T presented and obviously undertaking a really big merger with SunTrust. They're going to change the name [indiscernible] (00:22:32) this quarter, you have moving the headquarters of the combined company to either of the current headquarter cities, and you put up your map, they put up their map and tremendous amount of kind of overlap. Can you talk to just potential opportunities you have from disruption whether it's customers or potential employees and just maybe plans you have in place to maybe capitalize on some of that potential disruption?",Jason M. Goldberg,Analyst,"Barclays Capital, Inc.",regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF.pdf
answer,"Well, it's something we discuss regularly, as you might imagine. Two very good banks, two really good leadership teams, putting those banks together will result in an awfully good outcome, but it will be – likely be challenging. We're the product of a merger of equals and so we understand some of the complications associated with that. And as a result, I'd say there likely will be associate and customer disruption and all of our teams are focused on what we can do to potentially take advantage of that, whether it be recruiting associates or trying to win customers. There are some markets like Atlanta and Orlando as an example where there should be particularly significant amount of opportunity, if you will. That's good news. Bad news is we have lots of competitors and they are thinking about the very same things. So, we understand we're going to have to execute well in order to benefit from the disruption that might occur. At the same time, we're knowledgeable that BB&T and SunTrust are going to do everything they can to ensure that there's a limited amount of activity. It should be – I think there will be a certain number of customers that are in play and we like to win them.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF.pdf
question,"I guess on the flip side, you mentioned – I think the words were, we're not currently interested in bank acquisitions. I guess at some point you just kind of dropped to we're currently in any – do you become interested and what would – what get you interested, just given that is less number of buyers in your region and presumably a lot of smaller banks don't have the scale that Regions has so could create opportunities.",Jason M. Goldberg,Analyst,"Barclays Capital, Inc.",regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF.pdf
answer,"Yeah. We currently doesn't have any sort of timeframe associated with it. I think it's important for us to earn the right to acquire through the execution of our plan. And if we do that, we deliver the 18% return on tangible common that we believe we can as a result of our plan. We should see the benefits of that in our stock price. And if we do, then our – the quality of our currency improves and the economics also improve. Having said that, we're not interested in M&A for the sake of M&A. We have a 15-state footprint. We're in some of the best markets in the country, plenty of opportunity to continue to invest in Regions in the markets that we operate in. And that will be our primary focus.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF.pdf
question,"And I guess the flipside is that you mentioned kind of 15 states although the core franchise is in smaller number than that. I guess, any thoughts when you've seen other banks do this to kind of further rationalizing your franchise and maybe exit some of those that kind of tertiary markets that you're in and kind of double down the efforts on the core franchise? Or is it, with the advent of some of these digital banking products, those kind of tertiary markets actually now become more viable to grow in.",Jason M. Goldberg,Analyst,"Barclays Capital, Inc.",regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF.pdf
answer,"Yeah. I think we constantly evaluate all of our businesses, our portfolios, our markets to ensure we're getting an appropriate return and to the extent we're not, we've got to be willing as we did with insurance or indirect auto to decide to exit. The same applies for markets. We're making investments in St. Louis because it's a sizable market. We have number six market share. We think that that the opportunity there is significant. We have reinvested or reorganized our franchise there. And as a result of the investment we've made, we now have access to more than 10%, more population and wealth in St. Louis. So that would be an example of somewhere that is a little further from our core southeastern franchise but still a market with a lot of connectivity and opportunity. We need to think about all of our markets in that context. Can we make additional investment to improve our opportunity? Are we not getting an appropriate return? If not, we should exit. We will, consistent with our plans, we'll close about 100 branches over the next three years. Our intention is to open 75. That might change. We could close more or less, open more or less. But those are to give you some idea about how we think about continually repositioning on our footprint. And again, our focus on risk adjusted returns has got to apply to portfolios, to businesses, to markets, to every aspect of our business.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF.pdf
answer,"And let me add to that too because it's important. We get this question a lot. Diversification is important to us as well. We live that during the time where concentrations of real estate in Florida and Georgia really hurt us. And so having a footprint, 15 states really, and certain of those away from the [ph] Gulf (00:27:57) South which we love and believe in, but at the same time we want to manage our risk appropriately. So, we think being in those other states really does matter to us and it's about how do we grow those, how can we make those investments really pay off for us. They all are profitable and so it's just optimizing each one of those, that's our goal.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF.pdf
question,"And I guess, John, you've mentioned the exiting of indirect auto. Yesterday, we had a bunch of banks talking about how they're growing the auto business and, obviously, has its ups and downs, but has stuck with it. Maybe talk about your decision kind of why you exited it.",Jason M. Goldberg,Analyst,"Barclays Capital, Inc.",regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF.pdf
answer,"Yeah. So, we're first and foremost focused on relationships and relationship-oriented businesses, and businesses that will generate an appropriate return on invested capital. And when you look at the indirect auto business, profit zones do open and close. There have been periods of time when it's been very profitable, other periods when it's not. Currently, it's certainly not for us. There are banks that are making money in it. I think most of them are taking a little more credit risk to do that. It is not a relationship business. We're not financing auto dealers. We're not – we don't have an expanded relationship with the end customer. And so, from our perspective, there are other things to do with the capital that we had allocated to that business. And as a result it's – because it's not relationship oriented, because we're not getting appropriate return, we're choosing to exit.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF.pdf
question,"I'm going to pause there and see if there's any questions from the audience. Credit quality has been a topic that really hasn't been a topic I guess at this conference. Clearly, we're several years into this economic expansion. Maybe talk to in terms of what size of portfolio – what parts of the portfolio you're keeping a kind of closest eye on given at some point credit is obviously cyclical and losses will trend back higher?",Jason M. Goldberg,Analyst,"Barclays Capital, Inc.",regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF.pdf
answer,"Yeah. So, there are a couple of places I think where we remain focused, more granularly on the restaurants, specifically the fast casual sector. We've seen some weakness there. In the healthcare space, particularly rural hospitals, we've had a healthcare specialization for a long time and have been an active participant in the not-for- profit healthcare sector and we're just seeing some weakness there, as a result of Obamacare there's been some shifting, winners and losers. And so, kept a cautious eye healthcare. Leverage lending, we have about $5.8 billion exposure, approximately 26% of that is sponsor owned and primarily enterprise value-based. And so, that's an area where we're actively managing. And then [ph] to all three risks (00:31:10), we have – we think high quality shared national credit portfolio but with it is large exposure and while the credit quality is good, it would then take one or two large exposures to create credit problems. But it is nice not to have to come to a conference and talk about credit quality. I hope that that trend will continue for a number of quarters, if not years, for all of us, frankly.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF.pdf
answer,"We had – I'll just add to that. So, we had expectations. John just mentioned to you 40 basis points to 50 basis points charge-offs this year, and we were 38 basis points in the first quarter. And for the three years, we're 40 basis points to 65 basis points of expectation. So, fairly benign expectation even though the economy, again, we forecast 2.5% GDP this year, 2% next year, and 1% after that, so a slowing economy but consumer is healthy, businesses are healthy, even though leverage in both of those is at higher than pre-crisis levels. The ability to pay for the debt service coverage continues to be very robust and strong. So, outside those few areas John mentioned, we feel credit quality is actually in pretty good shape. And all the work we've done, our credit team, risk management teams have done on concentration risk management since the crisis is going to pay dividends for us in the future.","David J. Turner, Jr.",Senior Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer,Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF.pdf
question,Yes?,Jason M. Goldberg,Analyst,"Barclays Capital, Inc.",regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF.pdf
error,"Q Thanks. Thank you for taking my question. Just I was hoping you might be able to elaborate a little bit on your sort of customer confidence for demand for loans. And it's interesting, the points you make about the population growth in any of the regions that you're in, are you expecting that your customers can actually grow their loans sort of faster than GDP or how are you thinking about it?",,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF.pdf
answer,"Yeah. So, customer confidence is good. I would say our customers are confident but cautious. Obviously, there's a lot of noise day to day coming out of Washington generally, and some concerns around the overall economy. But I've visited, I don't know, 10 or 12 markets over the last couple of months. I've probably met with 50 or more customers in different forums. And customers are consistently optimistic. They had good 2018s. Many of them had the best years they've ever had largely or in some measure as a result of tax reform. 2019 looks good. It's off to a good start. And so confidence is high. We see customers investing in their businesses. The biggest issue customers have today is workforce. As you talk to customers about why they're potentially not investing or what they might do but chose not to do, it is in some measure limited by their ability to hire and staff whatever it is that they might invest in. So workforce is an issue for the economy. And then tariffs are having some impact but I think it's more sort of broadly the noise associated with all of that that give business some concern, but confidence is good. And so we'd say, given the markets that we operate in, we would expect to grow sort of with GDP plus a little. If we get growing too much faster than GDP, we think we're probably taking more risk than we should at this point in the economic cycle. Now, we don't know when the cycle ends or when it turns. So what we talk about is let's just do good business every day. Let's focus on quality clients, on sound underwriting, on proactive credit servicing, make sure we know our customers, we're getting paid for the risk that we take. If we do those things, regardless of where we are in the economic cycle, we should see consistent sustainable performance over time. And, again, we don't have to grow a lot to perform well. We think we can deliver 18% to 20% return on tangible common, we grow loans that are at sort of the same rate we're growing our core deposit, we really – that's when we perform best.","John M. Turner, Jr.","President, Chief Executive Officer & Director",Regions Financial Corp.,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF.pdf
error,Q Thank you.,,,,regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF.pdf
question,"I guess after repurchasing a lot of stock, your CET1 ratio I guess, what, 9.7%, nearing that 9.5% target that you talked about. I guess two questions is, one, how do we think about capital return now that you're approaching your target? I know CCAR changes a bit this year. And just how should we think about that? And then secondly, is 9.5% the right number or just given how much you've de-risked this franchise, is there an ability to see that number creep lower over time?",Jason M. Goldberg,Analyst,"Barclays Capital, Inc.",regions,other,../data/other/transcript\regions_RF.pdf
answer,"Yeah. So, our target is 9.5%. We'll get there in the third quarter just mathematically. So, through June, we're based – all of our capital actions are at last year CCAR. So, as we think about capital return for the capital we generate, our net income, as John mentioned, first and foremost, we'll apply that to organic growth. That's important to us. That'll use up a piece. So, take your low-single digit – middle-digit loan growth, hold 9.5% of that, and that's the piece. Second would be our dividend. Our dividend expectation is 35% to 45% of income. Today, we're right at 30%. So, there should be an expectation of our dividend increasing to that mid part of the range to maybe the upper end over time. And we would like to find a bolt-on acquisition to help grow noninterest revenue. Those generally don't use a lot of capital but some. And then the toggle is the share repurchase. We really don't like to borrow stock back. We'd like to invest it back in our business. But if we have that excess capital that we generated, then we will get it back in the form of share repurchases. The beauty of the new regime is that we can manage our capital more freely. So if loans grow a little faster than we thought, then we wouldn't buy back as much stock. Conversely, if loans aren't growing, we would buy back stock because we think 9.5% is the right number for us today. Now, that is derived mathematically. We started 4.5% regulatory limit. We had 250 basis points of cushion there, a buffer to get the 7%. 7% is our limit that we set internally. The theory is we never want to breach that and ever have to cut our dividend like we had to in a crisis. So with the sustainability of the dividend, that's really important to us. From that, we look at the risk inherent in our book and that's about 200 basis points. So we get the 9% and we've added a management buffer of 50 basis points on top of that. And just given that we're in the 10th year of an expansion, we can get to our 18% to 20% return on tangible common with that extra 50 basis points in the denominator anyway. So why not have a little extra dry powder to maybe take advantage of opportunities should they arise, maybe some opportunities to grow loans where others can't because they've gotten themselves in a spot where they can't continue to grow. So, that's really where the 9.5% – so mathematically, yes, Jason, we could bring it down a little bit. We choose not to do so right now because we can meet all the goals that we laid out.","David J.
