Scratchpad about how to improve

## Automation
Matt Scarpino seems to have some good resources about XBRL

Use the following to automate pulling in of XBRL https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1227268/Accessing-Financial-Reports-in-the-EDGAR-Database

Use the tutorial to think about how to take in specific data that might be relevant
https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1227765/Parsing-XBRL-with-Python

Use beautifulsoup to automate pulling documents from Bank websites and putting them in the appropriate directory rather than doing it manually.

## Data Sources
Seems like there are some other places to get transcripts of calls that may be "cleaner" especially because it seems some banks do not provide the transcripts themselves like Regions does (BOA for example). Are they all free? Can they be scraped effectively and is that allowed?
